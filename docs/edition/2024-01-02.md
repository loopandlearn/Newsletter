## Tips for Building or Rebuilding with a Browser

Each time you rebuild:

* Check to see if the customizations you selected last time are still valid or need to be updated:
    * [Customize with Browser](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/custom-browser/)
* Check to see if you need to accept a new agreement with Apple Developer:
    * [Accept Agreements](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-update/#accept-agreements)

Once a year, you will need to renew your certificates:

## Do You "Think Like a `Loop`?"

Here’s a helpful article by the late, great Katie DiSimone that bears reading and rereading from time to time. One of our experts says, “I have read those pages so many times and they still resonate so well with most of the thinking and ’WHY isn’t this working like I want?’". 

This article is valid for any closed loop system, `Loop`, `iAPS` or even commercial systems.

## Alert for *iAPS* Users

Warning - a logic error was accidentally introduced in version 2.2.7 of the *iAPS* app.

Please rebuild as soon as possible if you are running versions 2.2.7 to  2.3.0 of the *iAPS* app.

How do I know if I need to rebuild?

* Look at the settings in the *iAPS* app to see the version you have built: if it says 2.3.1, or higher, you have the fix

* This fix was added to `main` on 30 December 2023, so if you did a sync to `main` or a fresh download after that date, you have the fix

* The bug was introduced to `main` on 22 November 2023

???- question "Do you want to know more? Click to open"
    This logic error came in at the same time as the option to completely silence your pod.

    This logic error can cause an 049 pod fault during pod setup in certain situations.

    The logic error was found and fixed in the `dev` branch almost immediately. It was added to the `main` branch, version 2.3.1 on 30 December 2023.
