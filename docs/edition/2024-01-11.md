## Automatic Temp Basal vs Manual Temp Basal

A [Temporary Basal](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/operation/algorithm/temp-basal/){:target="_blank"} (TB) can be issued by the *Loop* app when in `Closed Loop` mode to regulate insulin delivery every 5 minutes. The *Loop* app determines when to enact  a TB and when to return to scheduled basal, using a prediction updated every 5 minutes (or when a new CGM reading is detected), based on user entries and settings. If the user has selected <span>Automatic Bolus</span> <span>Dosing Strategy</span>, then TB are only used to reduce the amount of insulin delivered. The TB automatically issued by the *Loop* app all have a duration of 30 minutes. If not further commands are detected by the pump, at the end of 30 minutes, the pump returns to scheduled basal deliver.

A [Manual Temporary Basal](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/loop-3/omnipod/#manual-temp-basal){:target="_blank"} (MTB) is a user-selected setting that effectively opens the loop and keeps insulin delivery steady at a user-defined rate for the user-defined duration (from 30 minutes up to 12 hours). If you use a Medtronic pump, you need to disable `closed-loop`, set MTB on your Medtronic pump and restore normal operation when done.

### Resuming Scheduled Basal

**Under normal operation**: The *Loop* app always sets a 30 minute TB. If the next prediction needs the same TB as the previous one, the TB is not modified to save the load on pump batteries. After 20 minutes, if the same TB is still required, then a new one is issued.

**If connection with the phone is lost**: The pump resumes scheduled basal between 10 and 30 minutes later, depending on when the last TB was initiated.

## Searching for Information?

We all have occasional troubles finding information through searches, but we urge you to use this valuable tool before asking questions on your favorite social media site. You may find lots more information than you realized is available.

A major exception is when you are too flustered or hurried to search- there’s usually someone online ready to help. In that situation, ask and then search! And -of course-  always be sure to seek help from emergency services first in an emergency!

## Enhanced Customization for Profiles

> Updated to add support for current Profile name in `Nightscout` and `Loop Follow`. Note - only the current profile is uploaded. Other profiles are stored only on the `Looper's` phone.

We’re excited to bring you the latest updates to the Profiles Customization for the *Loop* app. At the same time, the *Loop Follow* app (v2.1.4) supports displaying that profile name if you use the customization. 

New features for the customization include:

* **Nightscout Display**: Your current active profile is now visible in Nightscout!
* **Bug Fix for mmol/L Users**: We’ve squashed a bug where the app could mistakenly detect a profile change and suggest an update!

New feature for the *Loop Follow* app (v2.1.4):

* `Loop Follow`: The user can select Profile as a display option to see the active profile used by the *Loop* app. If the profile customization is not applied to the *Loop* app, this simply shows `Default`.

Get the Updates:

* The enhanced [Profile Save & Load](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-features-in-development/#pr-2002){:target="_blank"} customization for the *Loop* app is available for both `main` and `dev` branches. You must rebuild to get the update using either [Browser Build](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#github-intro){:target="_blank"} or [Mac Build](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#customization-select){:target="_blank"}.

* [`Loop Follow`](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/#build-lf){:target="_blank"}: You need to build version 2.1.4 (released 18 January 2024) or newer to get the Profile display support.

We’re committed to continually improving Profiles in `Loop` and `Loop Follow`. Your feedback is invaluable, so please share your experiences and suggestions with us.

## Always use Automatic Time

If you turn off automatic time and manually change the time while using the *Loop* app, you might get into a situation where the app crashes repeatedly. You can turn off permissions for `Loop` in Apple Health and might be able to operate, but this limits long-term storage on your phone. Set Screen Time, with a PIN, which will disable your -or your child’s- ability to change the phone’s time. If the *Loop* app crashes because of a time change, you will have to delete Loop off the phone completely, rebuild a fresh version, and repopulate all info to resolve the issue.

!!! question "Why would someone change the time on their phone?"
    One reason is to get more gaming time. So if you or your T1D child use the *Loop* phone for gaming, do yourself a favor and don’t change the time! Lock out the options with: iOS Settings, Screen Time, Lock Screen Time Settings and apply a PIN. This disables the ability for anything other than automatic time.

    To check that your phone is on automatic time, go to iOS Settings, General, Date & Time.
