## Diabetes Community Involvement

We are excited that numerous members of our team are participating in diabetes conferences. This not only helps to educate us better, it also helps insert more of the people behind&nbsp;<span translate="no">DIY looping</span>&nbsp;and support into the conversations that take place high up in the diabetes realm- a great thing for all of our interests!

## Fix for Error: Build with Browser

If you have a build failure with the Browser Build that used to be working and get a message similar to that below, check to be sure that all of your credit card info in Apple Developer is current - including any change to expiration date. If not, update it and the build should work.

## Update for the *Loop Follow* App

Optimized for Better Mileage

Your feedback is invaluable to us, and we eagerly await your thoughts on this update for the *Loop Follow* App.

Highlights for the improvements:

üîã Battery Efficiency

While we've aimed to reduce battery consumption, we're not promising miracles. The *Loop Follow* app might still be among the apps that drain your battery the most. However, we have optimized how Carbs Today, SAGE, and CAGE data are fetched, and we hope this results in a more efficient performance. Please share your observations regarding any changes in battery life.

üìÜ Sensor Start Date Issues

We have addressed a peculiar issue where the Loop dev may be uploading sensor start dates set to the year 2159, affecting SAGE readings. This version will ignore future sensor start dates.

üî¢ New Versioning

Starting with this release, you will see versioning in the *Loop Follow* app. Check the bottom of the settings page for the version number‚Äîthis release is labeled as 2.0.0. While not a major milestone, it's a starting point for future refinements.

üõ†Ô∏è Code Refactoring

Behind the scenes, we have overhauled how Nightscout data is downloaded and processed, involving more than 2000 lines of code. This comprehensive change could potentially introduce undiscovered bugs, so please report any issues you encounter.
