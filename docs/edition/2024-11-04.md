## Diabetes Awareness Month

Help yourself be more “aware” by making a daily effort to use the resources that the Loop and Learn Team and others in the Open Source community work so hard to make available to you. Check out some of the [Helpful Links](#helpful-links) to get started.

## Real-Time Hack Watch

Hack 2024 is just 2 days away, on November 6th!

We're planning something special - a 30-minute behind-the-scenes opportunity to see the mayhem when 30 developers and volunteers from across the globe brainstorm the future of open source automated insulin delivery systems and associated apps: Loop, Trio, AAPS and Nightscout.

[Join us on Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/j/89085412738?pwd=eXpTN2M5V3M0TEVJQktmVldBTVRYUT09){:target="_blank"} at 12 p.m. PT/ 3 p.m. ET/ 9 p.m. CET for a glimpse into what’s happening!

## *Apple* Developer Agreement

Whether you use Browser Build or Mac-Xcode Build, you need to sign your new [*Apple* Developer Program License Agreement](https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/){:target="_blank"} as soon as possible. The due date is 5 or 6 November 2024 depending on where you live. If you don't sign by the due date, you can no longer build a new version of your app. Furthermore, if you use remote commands with *Apple* Push Notification, those will stop working as well.

## Important *Dexcom* Follow Safety Note

A *Dexcom* user [reported on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/anubisg6/posts/for-those-of-you-using-the-dexcom-app-and-who-rely-on-the-follow-feature-check-y/1088102602972114/){:target="_blank"} that their son’s *Dexcom* DID NOT alert any of their family members when it had lost signal/received no data like it usually does. Her son experienced very low glucose while the signal was lost and wound up in the ICU as a result. The hospitalist told them that this is the second kid this week with *Dexcom* communication issues.

The mom looked into her app settings and the “no data notification” alert was turned OFF on both parents’ phones, and the “Signal Loss” notification was turned OFF on her son’s phone. They are certain they had those alerts turned ON and think there might have been an update from *Dexcom* that turned them off. She has checked with friends who have also found alerts to be off and she has contacted *Dexcom* about this concerning and dangerous issue. This may have been associated with an update to iOS 18.

We are glad to hear that all is okay with her T1D son and encourage checking alert settings before bed. We
also recommend [Loop Follow](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/){:target="_blank"} for its many wonderful features, including superior alarm capabilities.
