## Version Updates

### Version 3.4.3

The [*Loop* app, version 3.4.3](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/version/releases/#loop-v343) is available.

This is a minor improvement with some fixes. It is important for both Browser Builders and Mac-Xcode Builders. 

* For `Browser Builders` who previously updated to `version 3.4.1`, your automatic update and build action on *GitHub* should run on Wed; you can then choose when to install `version 3.4.3` from *TestFlight* onto your phone
* For `Mac-Xcode Builders`, if you used *Xcode* 16 and don't see an expiration date in your app, please get a fresh download and build again

> *WARNING* If you are running `dev` branch for any reason and are not a serious developer and tester: change to `main` immediately. Really big changes are expected to appear in the `dev` branch with no warning. All improvements previously in `dev` are in the new release, Loop 3.4.3.

> CHANGE TO `main` NOW!

### iOS Update

Though we are unaware of critical operational issues with iOS 18.0.1, a number of annoying problems have been reported. Our experts stand by their statement that it is best to wait when Apple provides a major releases for iOS so you do not inadvertently become a beta tester.

* The current suggestion is to wait for at least iOS 18.1, and we will update our recommendation again when that version is available.
* If you are on iOS 17 / watchOS 10 - stay there:
    * Under General, Software Updates, you will be offered iOS 17.7 - that update is fine to accept
    * Do not accept an update to your watch at this time - stick with watchOS 10.x
* If you are on iOS 18.0:
    * Please update to iOS 18.0.1 at your earliest convenience
        * You will find this version under software update; it is reported to improve several user interface issues
    * Similarly, if your watchOS is already at 11.0, please try 11.0.1 - we have heard it improves things

Check our [Version Updates](https://www.loopandlearn.org/version-updates/) page (and the [FB group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LOOPandLEARN)) for updates.

This is not an issue, but users who rely on password interface to apps like Loop, LoopCaregiver and LoopFollow should know that the iOS Settings have been rearranged in iOS 18. Specifically, Passwords were moved to their own app rather than being included in Settings.

### Issues reported by iOS 18.0 users:

* LoopCaregiver - Xcode 16 - Watch widget issue
* watchOS 11.0 - difficult to install Loop, Siri watch face is unavailable - Siri watch face
enabled glucose updating promptly on the watch.
* Loop - if built with a free developer account, NFC (Near Field Communication) is unavailable; NFC is required for EU Libre 2 users
* The User Interface slows down and is especially bad immediately after a build
* If you update and run into operational or other issues, there aren’t a lot of people with experience to help you fix them.
