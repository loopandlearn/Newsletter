## Behind the Scenes

Any idea how many times the LnL team exchanges messages about documentation in any given week? What triggers our discussions?

* The *Loop* branch `dev` gets updated
* We prepare for the next release of the *Loop* app
* Customizations are added or adjusted, with associated documention
* Methods for building Loop (Browser and Mac builds) are updated
* Accessory apps are created or updated
* Someone tells us that they can’t understand something in the docs and we think of better -or more succinct- ways to explain it
* Questions get asked that indicate documentation needs clarity
* Apple updates an operating system (iOS, macOS, Xcode version)

Thanks to all who participate in our community by asking questions and letting us know when something needs clarifying - you help us all!

### Answer to Behind the Scenes

The answer is between 50 and 75 messages. We work hard to keep things up-to-date and informative.

## Be Ready to Rebuild

A reminder: If you are using the *Loop* app or any other DIY APS, be ready to rebuild whenever the need arises. That may come for one of many different reasons, which may take you by surprise. Tips for managing with the least stress include:

* If you are a [Mac builder](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/build/overview/){:target="_blank"}, update your iOS in a timely fashion after Apple releases a new one, so it’s ready to go if you need to build in short order
* Don’t update iOS ahead of Mac OS. Check [Version Updates](https://www.loopandlearn.org/version-updates/){:target="_blank"} first!
* When you update to the newest iOS, be prepared to be loopless during download, update, reboot an then possibly while Apple Health indexes. The index delay doesn't happen to everyone, but if it happens to you, it may take up to an hour.
* Allow yourself enough time to rebuild. When we decide to DIY Loop, we do so with the understanding that app is experimental and that we may need to rebuild at any time. If you have time limitations, be sure to be ready to revert to traditional pump therapy if something happens to your Loop app or if you are unable to rebuild at a moment’s notice.
* When you do a rebuild, consider using the [Browser Build Method](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-overview/){:target="_blank"}. With that, the first-time setup takes a couple of hours, but then rebuilds take less than a minute to trigger, right from your phone, anywhere you have an internet connection. Very frequently, someone needs to rebuild urgently because they dropped or lost their phone. If you’re a Mac builder and there’s any chance you’re going to be in a situation without the time or access to rebuild on a Mac, please consider setting up Browser Build as well. Even if you don’t install it, it will be ready, just in case. When you do, it will install over your old version. Watch this short [Browser Build video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ipTsiqbbrQ){:target="_blank"}!
* The app expires every 90 days, but you can rebuild using your iPhone and it only takes a few minutes. Dev has an auto rebuild feature and Loop 3.4 will have it as well.
* Loop and Learn has volunteers on Facebook that can help you virtually, 24/7/365 across all time zones should you run into issues.
