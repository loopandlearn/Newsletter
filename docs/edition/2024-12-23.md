## *Dexcom* G7 Geofencing Update

Geofencing Update: Advocacy at Work

Over the past 2 years, we’ve helped numerous stressed Loopers fix this issue mid-vacation so they could keep their CGM working. It was a long haul and a lot of work by our team and others. Here’s great news...  

With the new Dexcom G7 app (v2.6.0), you can reconnect anywhere!

Please note that your initial setup of the Dexcom G7 app must be done in your home country. The first time you start the app, it verifies that the country you are in matches the country of residence in your account. This ensures you receive the resources and features approved for use in your location.

Thanks to those who raised their voices, including [Stacy Simms of Diabetes Connections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQd2zpd3gaY){:target="_blank"}, who joined our efforts to keep G7 usable for international travelers. Perseverance paid off!

## *Dexcom* G7 Pairing Help

Trouble pairing your G7 sensor? Here’s a helpful tip:

* When the sensor is inserted, it goes past a magnet that turns on the sensor
* If your sensor doesn't activate automatically, you can run a magnet over it to activate a switch that, when turned off conserves battery. 
* The applicator contains magnets or you can use any common one you have on hand.

## What is Goosenecking

More information about the *Dexcom* G7 sensor. Thanks to [Carb Counting Mama](https://carbcountingmama.ca/){:target="_blank"} who posted this information on her [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/carbcountingmama/posts/pfbid02fz8Wwm6yfSj4q6bN4NXuwVnQkFN2z2QCwpetCAKPY1QgukptAMsnpuanm51rpe65l){:target="_blank"}. You can see a [photo on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dexcom/comments/11p51kh/g7_insertion_failure/?rdt=40835){:target="_blank"} if you don't use Facebook.

"Goosenecking"

This is a term specific to the *Dexcom* G7 sensor. Upon insertion, sometimes the filament wire will not insert properly and will be poking out of the small hole on the back of the sensor. Hopefully, this never happens to you, but if it does, know that you didn't do anything to cause it to happen. Report it to *Dexcom* to get a replacement.

## End of Year Checklist

Many of us have a little “breathing room” during the last week of the year. Here’s a great way to still be productive during that time-
and things you’ll want to do even if you don’t find yourself with extra end of year time.

* Be sure you are using [Loop 3.4.4](https://www.loopandlearn.org/version-updates/#loop-updates){:target="_blank"} instead of an earlier version.
* Former Loop-dev users who have moved back to Loop-main should [remove Loop-dev from TestFlight](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/build-dev-browser/#what-happens-in-testflight){:target="_blank"}. This should include all Loop users who are not actively testing developments in the dev branch at this time.
* Make sure you have an up-to-date [Apple Developer agreement](https://developer.apple.com/account){:target="_blank"} and have your account set to auto-renew, with a credit card on file, if possible.
    * Follow these instructions to declare [non-trader status](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/browser/prepare-app/#digital-service-act-compliance){:target="_blank"} at Apple to comply with the Digital Service Act.
* Check your app (bottom of the *Loop* Settings screen) to see when you’ll need to rebuild (if you build with a Mac) or reinstall from TestFlight (if you use Browser Build) and put reminder(s) on your calendar.
* Put [Open Mics](#upcoming-zoom-sessions){:target="_blank"} on the calendar for 2nd Thursdays and join us!
* Subscribe to have this newsletter delivered to your inbox (if you haven't already done so, use the new google form to add your name for when we change newsletter services).
    * [Add your email address for newsletter](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeu64I0Ygauk079Q0lMhEcPq-IydPmscm2UCie6uxXfkfdmWw/viewform){:target="_blank"}
* [*Dexcom* G7 users should update to v2.6 of the *Dexcom* app](https://www.loopandlearn.org/g7-geofence/){:target="_blank"}.
* GitHub users (this means you!) are now required to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) as an additional security measure before January 26, 2025 or be restricted from account actions. See this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-two-factor-authentication){:target="_blank"}
* When you have a CGM or pump failure, in addition to calling it in to the manufacturer, please report it to the FDA using this [form](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/index.cfm?action=reporting.home){:target="_blank"}.
    * Reporting can help make our tech more reliable and you do NOT have to be a US user to do this!

## Where did that Bolus come from?

Ever wonder whether a bolus was manually entered or automatically delivered by Loop? Here’s how to tell:

* Tap on either Insulin plot on the main screen to open the Insulin Delivery, Event History screen
* If the pump event is still in history, tap on it to view the full display
* You will see a wall of text
    * What you are looking for is this:
    * automatic: Optional (false) means a manual bolus was entered
    * automatic: Optional (true) means Loop calculated a recommended bolus and issued it automatically

Note that all times in this view are in UTC, not your local time zone.

Are you surprised that a bolus was manual? Pro-tip: Always lock your phone before putting it away to avoid an accidental bolus.
