## Updates and Upgrades

The [Version Updates](https://www.loopandlearn.org/version-updates/#ios-updates) page is updated with iOS 17.3 as the latest tested version.

The [*LoopDocs*](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/) website user experience has been improved! When users click on external links, they open in a new window or tab, depending on the browser’s setup. An up-right arrow is to the right of each external link.

And we have another helpful video in our “How to Build” series: Quick, Easy, Awesome! (Less than 4 minutes)

## A Model Request for Help


We often have occasion to outline things to include in help requests. Here’s an example of a request where the person saved a lot of time by providing thorough information upfront.

!!! tip ""
    I am hoping that someone may have a magic fix for remote commands. I have successfully been using remote actions to dose and enact overrides for my son since they were released. They up and stopped working last week and I can not figure out a fix. I have gone through all of the Remote troubleshooting steps and remote errors on LoopDocs and have had no luck. Nightscout and my son's phone are not communicating...when I enact an override on either it can not be seen on the other. Anyone been through this and found a solution? I'm about to lose my mind after 8 hours of failing to troubleshoot.

    I have tried:

    * Rebuilding loop and loop caregiver
    * Checking my developer account status
    * Checking notification settings
    * Removing and re-adding push authentication
    * Turning off Cellular and WiFi (separately)
    * Double checking that push notifications were enabled for loop
    * Rebooting the phone
    * Removing all non-medical apps
    * Confirming that Background app refresh was on for loop
    * Double-checking all focus settings
    * and some other stuff.

    What am I missing? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

## DIY, Not “Have Someone Do It For You”

At `Loop and Learn`, we are deeply committed to supporting the DIY looping community. DIY stands for ‘Do It Yourself,’ emphasizing personal initiative with the understanding that you’re not alone, thanks to community support and shared expertise.

We understand that the idea of building your own loop system can seem daunting at first. However, there are several compelling reasons to consider taking the DIY approach:

1. **Empowerment through Education**: Engaging in the process of building your own loop system provides a deep understanding of its workings, empowering you to effectively manage your system and troubleshoot issues with confidence.
2. **Community Support**: The strength of the DIY loop community lies in its foundation of mutual support and shared knowledge. By choosing the DIY path, you join a network of experienced individuals who offer guidance, support, and a wealth of collective knowledge, often surpassing what paid services can provide.
3. **Cost Efficiency**: While the initial setup might seem challenging, the DIY route can lead to significant cost savings in the long run. This approach eliminates ongoing service fees, making it a financially sustainable option for managing your health.
4. **Customization and Personalization**: Building your own system allows you to tailor it to your specific needs and preferences, resulting in a more effective and user-friendly experience that aligns with your lifestyle.
5. **Independence and Self-Reliance**: The knowledge and skills gained through the DIY process foster a sense of confidence and independence, reducing reliance on third-party services. This is invaluable, especially in situations where immediate external support is not available.

We recognize that certain challenges, such as limited access to technology or lack of technical expertise, can make the DIY approach seem less accessible. However, the community is here to support you, offering resources, advice, and sometimes even hardware assistance to help you get started.

Choosing to build and manage your own loop system is a rewarding journey that brings not only financial savings but also a greater sense of control and community connection. We encourage everyone interested in DIY looping to reach out to the community for support and to explore the resources available to embark on this empowering path.
