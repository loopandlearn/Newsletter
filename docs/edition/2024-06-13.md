## Important Information From WWDC24

The World-Wide Developers Conference 2024 (WWDC24) held at *Apple* this week had some interesting presentations. There are three issues that people who build their own app need to be aware of:

* There is a new Apple Developer agreement to sign; you cannot build again until you sign this
* iOS 15 devices might not be useable for [Loop](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/build/phone/#which-devices-are-compatible){:target="_blank"} soon (Trio and iAPS already require iOS 16)
* Do **not** not put beta versions of iOS on your phone or Xcode on your computer; let the experts do that work so they can tell you when it is safe to update

The next released version of iOS is expected in September 2024.

## G7 is Geofenced

The G7 app cannot be updated or installed outside of your home country. If you are doing such traveling, remember to have a backup plan!

## Better Search Results

A frequent cause of difficulty during searches is the entry of too many search terms. Often, one of them doesn’t adequately match what is being searched for, so results are not returned. Start with one- or two-word terms and add to them if you get too many hits and need to narrow them down.

In LoopDocs, sometimes only part of a word is best:

* If you type "auth" in the search box, you are shown links that include the words "authenticate", "authorization" and "authentication"

* If you type "authorize" in the search box, no links are provided

## Rebuild Before You Need To

A reminder: do your [Browser](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-update/){:target="_blank"} (or [Mac-Xcode](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/build/updating/){:target="_blank"}) rebuild early to ensure that you are never without your app. Browser builds last for 90 days and Mac-Xcode builds last for a year.

Sometimes we find that time is shorter than we expected or there is a problem building that you need help with. Build early and keep on looping!

## GitHub Organization Account

This is a tip for folks who feel fairly comfortable with the Browser Build method and who build more than one app. Using an organization means you only enter the Secrets one time (for the organization) and then can add other apps (by forking to the organization) and just start running the actions.

This link has instructions to create a free GitHub Organization Account and use it to build your apps.

## What is Beta Testing?

You may have heard that Trio (a version of OpenAPS on an iPhone) is open for beta testing. What does that mean?

If you play video games you may have heard about games being released as a "Beta test”. The same concept is used in Open-Source Automated Insulin Delivery (OS-AID) systems, also known as DIY.

Essentially, the developers categorized the known issues, added some new features and prepared a list of items that users need to be aware of. Because this is an insulin-dosing algorithm rather than a game, extra care is used. Before announcing the beta test, the Trio developers kept the repositories private. As part of the private testing, the developers used this app on themselves as well as test phones. They had the advantage of starting with iAPS version 2.3.3 so they could build on the work of many developers. Once they felt it was ready for beta test, the repositories were opened for public access.

During the beta test, the app is only recommended for experienced testers. As it nears the end of beta test, there will be a release candidate (for final review) followed by a release to Trio version 1.0.0. The Trio developers know there is a lot of excitement, but please wait for the release unless you are willing to follow along in [discord](https://discord.gg/kyjG4333Wb){:target="_blank"} as a beta tester.

If you want a peak under the hood, this [link](https://github.com//nightscout/Trio/pull/2){:target="_blank"} provides a preliminary look at the Trio updates.
