## World Diabetes Day - Open Mic

On [World Diabetes Day](https://worlddiabetesday.org/){:target="_blank"}, thirty loopers from around the world joined in an Open Mic session. One of the themes was to provide information about Hack '24 held on 6 November 2024.

## Nightscout Foundation

A note from James Wedding, President, [Nightscout Foundation](https://www.nightscoutfoundation.org/){:target="_blank"} about the Hackathon 2024:

> When we began the Nightscout Foundation, we hoped it would be a vehicle for sustaining and driving open-source development in the diabetes world. Thanks to the generosity of this community, we were able to put together yet another hack, literally bringing together developers from around the globe. These folks give so much of their time to support us all, and I'm so proud that we can support them financially to attend these events.

> Thank you to every single person who contributed to this focused effort. Keep an eye for future events!

## Loop and Learn

Loop and Learn extends our thanks to the Nightscout Foundation and to our outstanding community, as well. Your support is truly helping shape the future of Automated Insulin Delivery, from which we all benefit.

## Hack '24 was a Great Success

On November 6, 2024, ten years, almost to the day, since Nightscout received their 501(c)(3) status, twenty-five developers and others from around the world gathered at the Microsoft office in San Diego, CA for Hack ‘24. People from Loop and Learn, Trio, Lotus (Nascence Biomed), AAPS teams, and developers in general- almost all of whom are “new” on the open source scene since the last Hack- collaborated on making our OS-AID systems even better, with the ultimate goal of reducing the burden on PWD. Groups were formed based on interest areas and people shifted groups as was reasonable. 

Here’s a recap from the perspectives of some of our Hackers:

David Burren and Tim Gunn of [Nascence Biomed](https://www.nascencebiomed.com/){:target="_blank"} say:

> We analyzed the implications of dynamic ISF and discussed improvements to the onboarding process. Currently, we use basal profiles, ISF (Insulin Sensitivity Factor), and CR (Carbohydrate Ratio) settings, but these values are often inaccurate and vary considerably, even with values from doctors. To address this, we reviewed different models—such as sigmoid and logarithmic functions in Trio and AAPS, along with a simplified model in Lotus. We developed plans for a more integrated approach, which we hope to test through retrospective analysis, aiming to make the system more consistent and adaptable across user profiles, regardless of gender, aging patterns, or weekly fluctuations.

> Additionally, we worked on standardizing the oref implementation across platforms, moving away from JavaScript to support a shared reference implementation rather than just a design. Progress was also made on the coding front, setting us up to deliver a more cohesive and accessible experience across platforms.

Other groups focused on topics such as AID testing/development, Nightscout and open source sustainability.

Theresa Hastings sums it up quite nicely, probably for all of us:

> If previous hackathons were anything like this one, I can say I now understand why this community took off like a bat outta hell years ago. The innovation that is driven through collaboration when a common goal is at the center easily becomes an unstoppable force. I felt it that day and have been coasting from the high ever since. The common theme in all of the discussions was unity. Improving the structure of DIY systems so innovations can be shared. This means we can combine our resources and share in the rewards of this hard work.

> Every day, I count myself blessed to be part of this community of innovators. For the first time, at the hackathon, I didn’t feel like an imposter but felt like I was at home. Together we will #NeverStopInnovating

## A Peek into the Hack

As promised, the Loop and Learn team at Hack ‘24 hosted an Open Mic, during which developers and the rest of us got to say hello and share a bit of what was going on, in real time. It was a quick little window in, helping loopers from around the world know that they, too, are a part of this revolutionary #WeAreNotWaiting movement!

## A Word From D-Data

More to come on the [Fall 2024 DiabetesMine Innovation Days](https://ddataexchange.com/){:target="_blank"}, but here’s a teaser. This [#NeverStopInnovating Video](https://youtu.be/SbBmrz87QmM%20){:target="_blank"}, showcasing the innovation at the core of our mission, was presented at the start of Day 2 of the DData ExChange conference.

## Facebook Post Removals

We have been fighting a lot of post removals in recent weeks and are hearing that some of our members are as well. We urge you to protest if yours gets removed...

* Immediately submit an appeal through the “Request a Review” process if it’s available. This is a direct way to contest the removal.
