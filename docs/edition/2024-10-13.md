## ADVOCACY APPEAL to the US FDA

[Sotagliflozin](https://www.inpefahcp.com/){:target="_blank"} is a once-daily oral medication that is currently approved by the FDA only for people with type 2 diabetes to improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of a stroke, heart attack, hospitalization, or death from congestive heart failure. Importantly, it is also used by people with type 2 diabetes to reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease.

On October 31, Lexicon, the makers of sotagliflozin, will be requesting approval from the FDA for its use by people with type 1 diabetes who have not achieved ideal glucose control and who also have chronic kidney disease (CKD) â€” a widespread and serious condition that leads to poor quality of life, increased sickness, and premature death. It is personal to us at Loop and Learn as some of our members have T1D and CKD and we want them to live a long and healthy life.

If approved, sotagliflozin would be the first oral medication approved for those living with type 1 diabetes since the discovery of insulin over 100 years ago.

You have the power to make a difference! If type 1 diabetes and chronic kidney disease have affected your life or that of someone you care about, [please consider submitting a letter to the FDA using these instructions](https://tcoyd.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FDAInstructions_2024-10-10.pdf){:target="_blank"} courtesy of our friends at TCOYD. Please note the deadline to submit is October 17, 2024! It only takes 5 minutes of your time! Thursday is the LAST DAY to appeal!

> **Yes! You can participate even if you live outside the US!**
