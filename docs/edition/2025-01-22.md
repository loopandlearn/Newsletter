## Adam Brown on Treating Ourselves with Kindness

Adam recently joined us via Zoom for an entertaining and thought-provoking exploration of how we can treat ourselves better as we juggle all the ups and downs of diabetes management. During 2025, let's challenge ourselves to be more like Coach Bob and less like Coach Lou.

Not sure who these coaches are? Watch this [Loop and Learn with Adam Brown Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2sPyaKLzsU&t=59s){:target="_blank"} to find out! Also check out [Adam’s slide deck](https://www.loopandlearn.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AdamBrown-BrightSpotsandLandmines-LoopandLearn-Jan162025.pdf){:target="_blank"}, which he kindly shared with us.

[Adam Brown](https://adambrowntherapy.com/){:target="_blank"} is the author of [Bright Spots and Landmines](https://diatribe.org/bright-spots-and-landmines){:target="_blank"} and he previously contributed to diabetes publications like [Close Concerns](https://www.closeconcerns.com/){:target="_blank"} and [diaTribe](https://diatribe.org/){:target="_blank"}. He now works as a therapist in private practice in San Francisco, supporting people with diabetes and other difficult life experiences.

## Build With Browser Videos

Building -and rebuilding- with a web browser is recommended. Here are two very popular (and quick!) videos that will help walk you through the processes.

* [Build: How to Build Loop with a Web Browser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiu5ho0MTW8){:target="_blank"}
* [Update/Rebuild: How to Update and Rebuild DIY Loop with a Web Browser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ipTsiqbbrQ){:target="_blank"}

The videos are indexed with time references which make it easy to repeat any steps you find confusing.

Here are a few updates that occurred after the Build video was released. These are also in the video notes.

Loop 3.4 was released after these were created, so keep that in mind as you follow along:

* NFC Tag Reading is now required for the “com.TEAMID.loopkit.Loop” Identifier, so be sure to keep that box checked
* For the API Key, instead of clicking “Keys”, now click “Integrations”
* The Add New Users section now looks different

Before you begin with either video, take a moment to read the video description for any updates or changes made since it was created.

Do you want to build Trio with a Web Browser - just change the `LoopKit/LoopWorkspace` references with `nightscout/Trio` and review the link listed below.

## New Customization: Negative Insulin Damper

Great news! We have a replacement for the former CustomTypeOne Negative IOB customization that prevented Loop from seeing and reacting to some or all of the accumulated negative IOB. This customization option adds a new model to Loop to handle this situation. Negative Insulin Damper is added to the Algorithm Experiments screen and is disabled by default- you decide if you want to turn it on. More details and a report on how this works are included in the link below. Check it out and see if you would like to add this customization to your collection!

## LoopFollow Updates

Our developers have packed LoopFollow with so many features that we’ve created a dedicated [LoopFollow Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1281905676265126){:target="_blank"}! If you’re using or considering LoopFollow, join us there to ask questions and connect with others.

#### New App Features

The latest version, LoopFollow v2.2.8, lets you follow your Looper’s glucose value in real time on your Apple Watch! With calendar integration no longer supported on newer watchOS versions, this update introduces a new and improved method for displaying glucose data. You can customize what you want to see in addition to glucose:

* Arrows or delta values
* Dynamic font size

This new method supports up to 3 Loopers.

Be sure to check out the updated [LoopFollow](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/){:target="_blank"} page on our website for new resources, including how to set up the new Contact feature to display glucose in real-time on your Apple Watch and how to use LoopFollow for Trio, as well as Loop.

## Browser Build Pro Tip: Save Yourself Some Headaches

Here’s an easy way to:

* Avoid seeing the dreaded "Loop Beta Expired"
* Avoid impact from Apple deciding you need to sign a new license agreement
* Avoid impact from the annual expiration of your Distribution Certificate (used by Browser Build)

#### Calendar Reminder

Put a note in your calendar on the second day of each month to confirm the auto build worked.

* Go to `https://github.com/Your-GitHub-Username/LoopWorkspace/actions`
* Make sure the automated build on the first of the month succeeded (green check mark)

If the build failed

* You have 90 days to take care of any problems. (Make sure you do!)

#### Update the Phone from TestFlight

If the build succeeded

* Take time in the next day or so to update your phone
* Look at the bottom of the Loop Settings screen to see when the current version will expire - if 30 days or less - install new version from TestFlight (optional if closer to 60 days)
* When building for a child, be sure to update their phone as soon as possible
    * Kids can forget to notify their parent when they get a notification that Loop is expiring soon
    
#### Ignore the Certificate will expire soon email

You may get an email that your certificate will expire in 30 days. No need to take any action on this. If you build today and your certificate expires tomorrow, your TestFlight build is still good for 90 days. Wait for your certificate to expire naturally. Do not add the extra headache of revoking certificates before they expire.
