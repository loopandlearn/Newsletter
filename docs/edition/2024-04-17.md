## Resource Page for New Members

Here’s a [Resource Page](https://www.loopandlearn.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Welcome-to.pdf){:target="_blank"} with info we like to make sure our new members/ new loopers have at their fingertips. Even if you’re not “new” here, please take a few minutes to see what’s included, and when you see someone who might need the info, point it out to them. We love seeing more people getting involved in helping fellow loopers! Thank you!

## How to Ask for Build Help

The best way to get help is to follow these directions. (Yes - we want you to actually **read** the information at these links **before** you post). This is not the discourage you from asking questions. This is to help us help you.

* [Browser Build Help](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-errors/#help-with-errors)
    * Give us your GitHub username and a brief description of your problem
* [Mac Build Help](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/build/build-errors/#posting-for-help)
    * Give us a full Xcode screenshot and a brief description of your problem

It’s not only helpful for the person needing help, but for the whole community, because it saves everyone valuable time!

## Browser Builders: Check Your GitHub Access

> To ensure that you can continue to build and use your apps without any issues, it’s important that you can log into GitHub, especially since TestFlight builds expire every 90 days.

Follow these easy steps:

1. **Check Your Login:** Try logging into your GitHub account. If you have trouble, you may need to reset your password. You can do this by visiting [GitHub's password reset page](https://github.com/password_reset){:target="_blank"}.
2. **Set Up a [Backup Login Option](https://github.com/settings/security){:target="_blank"}**
3. **SMS/Text Message:** This is a simple way to receive a code on your phone that you can use to log in. This is helpful if you ever forget your password.
4. **Authenticator App:** Apps like Google Authenticator or Authy can also help. They generate a code that you enter when you log in to GitHub.
5. **Keep Your Recovery Codes:** When you set up your login options, GitHub gives you some recovery codes. Keep these in a safe place. They can help you get back into your account if you have trouble with your password or your phone.
6. **Please Take Action:** Spend a few minutes today to ensure you can log into GitHub easily. This will help avoid any untimely problems and make sure you can always build Loop when you need it.

!!! warning "Two-Factor Authentication is required by 20 May 2024"
    GitHub users are now required to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) as an additional security measure. You will need to enable 2FA on your account before 20 May 2024 to continue to use your GitHub account. 

## Open-iAPS Update from the Development Team

Kelsey Huss recently shared [this update on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1351938092206709/posts/1569139557153227/){:target="_blank"}:

“We understand that it has been quiet for a while. It has been quiet because we have a group of developers diligently working in the background to create something that we have now titled “Open-iAPS.” The people who come together when the DIY community is in need is amazing. We have had folks from all the different DIY systems come together to collaborate on this project.

While it's difficult to predict the exact timeline of a project, we're excited to share the significant strides we've made over the past months. We made a crucial decision to create a fully open-source and peer-reviewed version of iAPS. A dedicated team of developers, project managers, and support staff was formed to shape our future vision. They've successfully forked the version 2.3.3 code base and have been diligently working to streamline the code, enhance its stability, and enable a wider review by the community.

We are very close to opening testing to beta testers. Please ensure you have filled out the volunteer form, so we can contact you. We hope that beta testing will be completed quickly and thoroughly so we can open the branch to the group.”

According to Theresa Hastings, the best candidates for testers are super users who are, at a bare minimum, familiar with reporting bugs. Parents/ caregivers should not be testing this on their children. If you are interested in being a tester and fit these specs, please fill out this [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1IKhw990HiHFPe13KCgyam7TtEwJKuyaJnpa2ToiFhL9T3g/viewform?pli=1){:target="_blank"} and select the Quality Assurance option.

## Anubis Wants Your G7s

The folks who bring us Anubis transmitters are asking for more Dexcom G7 transmitters, both used and new. Please save your used G7s and donate them by sending to [one of these addresses](https://www.loopandlearn.org/anubis-mailing-address/){:target="_blank"}.

As always, they would appreciate receiving more Dexcom G6 transmitters, too!
