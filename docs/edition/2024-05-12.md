## Top 5 Browser Build Tips

A lot of build help has been needed lately and we have some tips for our browser builders. You will save yourself and our mentors LOTS of time and effort if you do these things:

1. Watch the video:
    * [Link to Build Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiu5ho0MTW8){:target="_blank"}
    * [Link to Update Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ipTsiqbbrQ&t=2s){:target="_blank"}
2. Read the documents:
    * [Link for First Time Builder in Documents](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-overview/){:target="_blank"}
    * [Link to Update Section in Documents](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-update/){:target="_blank"}
3. Don't start deleting secrets or repositories- or anything else
4. Provide your *GitHub* username & steps already taken when posting for help 
5. Make a Secrets reference file and keep a backup
    * [Link to new Make a Secrets reference file in LoopDocs](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-first-time/#make-a-secrets-reference-file){:target="_blank"}

If you don’t need to build soon, great! It’s a good time to go ahead and (re)watch the video, (re)read the documents and make that Secrets reference file (new section in LoopDocs) for when you need it!

!!! tip "Be Courteous, Help Others"
    When you post for help, respond to questions from the people who volunteer their time to help you.

    If you solve your issue on your own, please return to your post and indicate it is resolved and post how you fixed it. That helps others.

## Updates for the *LoopFollow* App

[Version 2.2.1](https://github.com/loopandlearn/LoopFollow/releases){:target="_blank"} of the [*LoopFollow* App](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/){:target="_blank"} is available. There have been several version updates recently that include these new or improved features:

✅ **Manual BG Values Display:** Now, manual blood glucose values entered in Loop or AppleHealth are available in LoopFollow. We've also fixed a bug where mmol/L manual BG checks from Nightscout weren't displaying correctly.

✅ **URL Sanitization and Validation:** We've enhanced the user experience by ensuring that URL input is sanitized—any characters not allowed in a URL are automatically removed.

✅ **Speech Output Improvements:** We've improved the clarity of speech outputs by replacing commas (when used as decimal separators) with periods. This makes spoken content easier to understand.

✅ **Behind the scenes**, we've updated the Gemfile.lock and bumped Fastlane to 2.220.0!

✅ **Recommended Bolus Alert:** Stay on top of your management with alerts for recommended boluses. The default sound is a catchy drum beat that visually connects with the picture in the background of this page. Customize the alert thresholds to suit your preferences.

✅ **Paste URL with Token:** Setting up has never been easier! You can now paste the entire URL, including the token, directly into the URL field. Just copy the URL+token from Nightscout (for example, `https://my.nightscout.com/?token=demo-3eda1548fee5d314`) and you’re good to go!

As usual, the new version is available as a browser build and a Mac-Xcode build. Don't forget that LoopFollow is available as three different apps for those with more than one Looper!

Dive into the new features and let us know how they work for you! Your feedback helps us keep improving!

## What do Version Numbers Mean in the *Loop* App?

* [Versions](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/version/overview-version/){:target="_blank"} are formatted “major.minor.patch” for the *Loop* app
* The `main` and `dev` `branches` are discernable at the minor level
    - `main` is even 
    - `dev` is odd
* Currently, `main` is 3.2.3 and `dev` is 3.3.0
* The next `main` update will either be 3.2.4 (for a small patch update) or 3.4.0 (if it’s decided to finally merge the current `dev` into `main`)

We always recommend waiting for major and minor versions to be tested by our experts before updating; they will be cleared on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LOOPandLEARN){:target="_blank"} and on our [website](https://www.loopandlearn.org/version-updates/){:target="_blank"}.

Updates at the patch level should be safe to build without the wait.
