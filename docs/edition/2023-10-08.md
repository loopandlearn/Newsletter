## Updates in&nbsp;_<span translate="no">LoopDocs</span>_

The [Safety Tips](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/safety-faqs/) page in&nbsp;_<span translate="no">LoopDocs</span>_&nbsp;has been updated. Here’s a list of topics:

* Know your settings
* Understand the App Displays
* Carb Entry and Insulin Delivery
* How to Cancel a Bolus
* Understand Delivery Limits
* Health app permissions
* Medtronic Easy Bolus button
* Finish your Medtronic priming

Additionally, this section is fairly new and should be studied. This was added in response to a FaceBook post that triggered lots of discussion:

* [How Do Delivery Limits Affect Automatic Bolusing](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/algorithm-faqs/#how-do-delivery-limits-affect-automatic-dosing)

If you are among the few who need to modify the relationship between "maximum Bolus" and "maximum IOB for Automatic Dosing", a customization was added to the [Code Customization](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/build/code-customization/) page.

## *US Med* *Dexcom* Supplies

*US Med* (a supplier of medical supplies in the US) is automatically switching *Dexcom* users to *G7*. If you get *Dexcom* *G6* supplies through *US Med* and would like to keep receiving *G6*, you need to call and let them know.
