## Tips for Building or Rebuilding with a Browser

Each time you rebuild:

* Check to see if the customizations you selected last time are still valid or need to be updated:
    * [Customize with Browser](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/custom-browser/)
* Check to see if you need to accept a new agreement with Apple Developer:
    * [Accept Agreements](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-update/#accept-agreements)

Once a year, you will need to renew your certificates:

## Do You "Think Like a `Loop`?"

Here’s a helpful article by the late, great Katie DiSimone that bears reading and rereading from time to time. One of our experts says, “I have read those pages so many times and they still resonate so well with most of the thinking and ’WHY isn’t this working like I want?’". 

This article is valid for any closed loop system, `Loop`, `iAPS` or even commercial systems.

## Alert for *iAPS* Users

Warning - a logic error was accidentally introduced in version 2.2.7 of the *iAPS* app. This is the version that provides you an option to completely silence your pod. This error can cause a problem with pairing if something causes the app to quit and resume before the pairing and priming has completed. The logic error was found and fixed in the `dev` branch almost immediately. It has been added to the `main` branch, version 2.3.1.

Please rebuild as soon as possible if you are running versions 2.2.7 to  2.3.0 of the *iAPS* app.
