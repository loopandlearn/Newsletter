## Update to `Loop 3.4.4`

We urge all Loopers to update your *Loop* app if you haven't already done so. Some of you are still on version 3.2.

Please read our information page, then go ahead and update to 3.4.4.

## *Apple* Developer Agreements

Guess what! You need to sign another *Apple* Developer License Agreement.

Got to this link to update your agreement:

## LnL DIY/OS Friendly HCP Resource

Are you new to the group? Or looking for a new endo/provider? We want to make sure you know about our [DIY (Open Source) Looping Friendly Healthcare Providers resource](https://www.loopandlearn.org/hcp-recommendations/){:target="_blank"}! Curated weekly, it provides information about 350 providers worldwide who support your use of a home-built AID system... and the list is still growing! If your healthcare provider is "DIY/ Open Source friendly", please be sure they are on the list! "Friendly" may mean anything from not giving you grief about using Open Source to actively helping you with your Loop or other system. To make a recommendation, after you open the link, scroll down to access the recommendation form. Thank you to our many friends who have already contributed to this great resource!

## Invite Your Friends to LnL Facebook Group

We love that so many LnLers want to have friends join us in our Facebook group! If you are one of them, will you please NOT use the "Invite" button, but send a group link to them instead? Using the "Invite" button causes a bypass of the group rules and required questions and delays their membership.

If you are not a member of the LnL Facebook group yet, consider this your invitation to join us there:
