## Do Not Post in Multiple Places

Cross-posting is becoming increasingly common: someone seeks help in one community and then duplicates their question in another. While this may seem like a strategy to expedite issue resolution, it's crucial to remember that this is a volunteer-driven online community. Every moment spent contributing is volunteered time. Cross-posting often results in duplicated efforts, with multiple volunteers unknowingly responding to the same query. Consequently, valuable time is squandered, hindering assistance for others awaiting responses.

Instead, consider the most relevant group for your question and post it there exclusively. If you don't receive a timely response, you can either "bump" your post or delete it from one group and repost it in another. This approach ensures efficient use of volunteer time and prioritizes equitable assistance for all community members.

If a mentor asks you to post the same information in a different location - that is different. Please leave your original post up so people in the current group can follow to the new location.

## _<span translate="no">Loop Follow</span>_&nbsp;Updates

The [*Loop Follow*](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/){:target="_blank"} app has new tech enhancements and user-focused improvements that you're bound to love!

 WHAT’S NEW in recent releases:

* Browser Build Boost: 
    * We've leveled up our browser build dependencies to Node 20, banishing those "Node.js 16 actions are deprecated" warnings.
* Xcode and iOS SDK Update: 
    * Staying ahead with Apple's evolving requirements, we've shifted our GitHub build to Xcode 15 and the iOS 17 SDK. This update keeps our app in line with the latest TestFlight requirements. 
* Accurate Build Expiration Date: 
    * Good news for TestFlight users! The app now accurately reports the build expiration date for TestFlight builds. 
* Snoozer Tab Revamp: 
    * Seeking a clearer view? We've significantly enhanced the Snoozer tab for you. With enlarged text and more visible BG delta and clock time fonts, glancing over your stats is effortless – whether your phone's right beside you or across the room.
* Scrolling and Viewing Made Better: 
    * Dive into your historical data without a hitch! We've introduced an intelligent auto-scrolling behavior. Manually scroll through your history, and the auto-scroll will pause, resuming only after 5 minutes of inactivity or if you navigate to the latest point in time. 
* Enhanced Data Clarity: 
    * To ensure you're always informed, we've added a strikethrough feature for stale glucose data (>12 minutes old) on both the main and Snoozer screens. Never be in doubt whether displayed glucose is up-to-date! 
* Say Goodbye to Watch Image Feature: 
    * This feature was a tad confusing for many and sparingly used. If this was a feature dear to you, we're all ears – let us know!

## Record Non-Pump Insulin BEFORE Recording Carbs

This is a big SAFETY issue: If you use non-pump insulin in association with adding a carb entry to Loop, be sure to add the insulin entry BEFORE recording the carbs. This will keep Loop from duplicating the insulin and overdosing you.
