## Enhancements to Profiles Customization

### New Features

Our [Profile feature](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-features-in-development#pr-2002), crafted to swiftly save and transition between therapy setting subsets tailored to your needs, has received a significant upgrade. Thanks to your invaluable feedback, here's what's new:

* **Active Profile Indicator**: Quickly identify your current profile with a
clear checkmark.
* **Manual Profile Sorting**: Organize your profiles exactly how you want
them.
* **Profile Update Alert**: Made changes to your therapy settings? Loop will
now suggest updating your profile. Alternatively, save these new
settings as a separate profile.
* **Profile Renaming**: Regret the initial name? Now you can change to a
new one.

This customization is compatible with both released&nbsp;<span translate="no">(main branch)</span>&nbsp;and development&nbsp;<span translate="no">(dev branch)</span>&nbsp;versions.

### How to Customize

If you don't already use customization, use this link for more information.

### How to Upgrade

#### <span translate="no">GitHub Browser</span>&nbsp;Build

#### Mac-Xcode Build

## <span translate="no">Loop Follow</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span translate="no">iAPS</span>

We're excited to share that the official&nbsp;<span translate="no">Loop Follow</span>&nbsp;app has now been upgraded to support users using&nbsp;<span translate="no">iAPS</span>&nbsp;(formerly known as&nbsp;<span translate="no">FreeAPS X</span>). A hearty acknowledgment goes to Auggie Fisher, whose pioneering work in a separate fork made this integration feasible.

For our&nbsp;<span translate="no">iAPS</span>&nbsp;followers, some of the features were not previously available in the&nbsp;<span translate="no">FAX fork</span>, but are now at your disposal:

* Browser build capability
* Auto-signing
* Automatic workspace selection
* And other&nbsp;<span translate="no">LoopFollow</span>&nbsp;enhancements

As always, we thrive on feedback and collaboration. Test the waters with the revamped&nbsp;<span translate="no">Loop Follow</span>&nbsp;and let the&nbsp;<span translate="no">iAPS</span>&nbsp;community know your take!

## <span translate="no">iOS 17</span>

Last week, we recommended upgrading to iOS 16.6.1 and WatchOS 9.6.2 for important security updates. We also recommended waiting to update to iOS 17, as itâ€™s still in beta and your Loop phone is a medical device. Beta is going well, but we are not changing these recommendations quite yet.
