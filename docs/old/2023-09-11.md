## Time to Update iPhone and Watch

Updating your phone to iOS 16.6.1 and watch to WatchOS 9.6.2 will provide important security updates. Thanks to our friends at Looped Norge for the heads-up.

Please Note: We recommend waiting to update to iOS 17, as itâ€™s still in beta and your Loop phone is a medical device

## Update your&nbsp;<span translate="no">Apple Developer Agreement</span>

PLEASE update your&nbsp;[<span translate="no">Apple Developer Agreement</span>](https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/)&nbsp;before Tuesday, 12 September... and expect to need to do so again soon. This is especially important for Browser builders, but is also important for Xcode builders. It will help keep your&nbsp;<span translate="no">Loop</span>&nbsp;app working.

## <span translate="no">LoopDocs</span>&nbsp;Remote Commands

Please take a look at the major rewrite of the [Remote Commands](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/nightscout/remote-overview/) section in the&nbsp;<span translate="no">Nightscout</span>&nbsp;Tab of&nbsp;<span translate="no">LoopDocs</span>. What was one page (remote-overrides.md) has been reorganized into 5 pages:

* Remote Overview
* Remote Configuration
* Remote Commands
* Remote Errors
