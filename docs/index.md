## Automatic Update and Build for the *Loop* App

If you updated to *Loop* version 3.4.1 using the Browser Build method, then you have the [Automatic Update and Build](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/automatic/){:target="_blank"} feature. This keeps the most recent version of the *Loop* app available in *TestFlight* for you to install when you are ready.

These events are automatically scheduled:

* Once a week: Check for a new release of the *Loop* app:
    * If found, your fork is automatically updated and a new build created and uploaded to *TestFlight*
* Once a month: Build the app and upload the fresh build to *TestFlight*

Your responsibility is to keep your Apple Developer account up to date and renew your Certificates once a year. This keeps a current version of the *Loop* app available in your *TestFlight* app when you are ready to install it on your phone.

## iOS Version Update

We have successfully built the latest versions of Loop-main, Loop-dev, LoopFollow,
LoopCaregiver and Trio to an iPhone running iOS 17.6 using a Mac running Xcode 15.4.

We consider iOS 17.6 to be safe for use with each of these apps.

## Feature Highlight: `Loop Follow`

Do you want to be alerted when your child's pod is getting low on insulin?

There’s an alarm for that! You can choose how you’d like to be notified on [`Loop Follow`](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow/){: target="_blank" } `Pump Alarm` screen.

## Dexcom G7 Geofencing

Big thanks to our own Joanne Milo for talking with Justin Eastzer on his [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Feh9N5j6vXU){: target="_blank" } to spread the word about Dexcom G7 Geofencing. This can cause serious hiccups for users traveling out of their home countries who experience difficulties. Thank you also to [Integrated Diabetes Services](https://integrateddiabetes.com/international-travel-with-dexcom-g7){: target="_blank" } for helping get the word out! We shared findings about this issue in our [*Facebook* group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LOOPandLEARN/posts/3758010451122098){: target="_blank" } and in previous News From `Loop and Learn` and will keep on pushing for *Dexcom* to resolve this troubling issue.  It’s really great to work with other voices in the diabetes realm to raise awareness about- and hopefully help solve- problems! 

## Customizing the *Loop* App

The&nbsp;[_<span translate="no">Loop and Learn</span>_&nbsp;Customization](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/){: target="_blank" } page has been updated for *Loop* version 3.4.1.

* The Customization Script was revised with new optons including
    * 2 hour Absorption Time for Lollipop
    * Display a Week of Meal History
    * Basal Lock
    * Live Activity / Dynamic Island
* The section to support adding a CGM such as xDrip4iOS or Glucose Direct is updated
* A new section is available for adding `Sooil Dana` pumps
    * Please be aware that the interface to the `Dana` pumps is still experimental

## Get Your Open Source-AID Merchandise

Want to show off your love for OS-AID? Lots of new options have been added to the [Nightscout Foundation’s store](https://nightscoutfoundation.myspreadshop.com/all){: target="_blank" } - check them out! There’s shirts, bags, caps, stickers, water bottles, mugs and even something for the babies. The proceeds benefit the [Nightscout Foundation](https://www.nightscoutfoundation.org/){: target="_blank" }.

## Helpful Tips

### Do not get sunscreen on your Pods

Remember- though your skin may appreciate sunscreen, your CGM and Pods do NOT and the plastic can crack. Take precautions to avoid getting sunscreen on them when you’re enjoying time in the sun this summer!

### Dexcom - try this before deleting your app

If you get a Dexcom message saying "App stopped working" that tells you to delete and reinstall the Dexcom app - try this first.

We recommend swiping the app closed and reopening! You can also try toggling Bluetooth off and then on or rebooting your phone. This often restores it to normal use and saves you a lot of headache- especially if you’re using G7 and are on a trip outside of your home country! See [Dexcom G7 Geofencing](#dexcom-g7-geofencing).

### America the Beautiful Pass

Type 1 diabetes qualifies U.S. citizens and permanent residents for a free lifetime pass to U.S. National Parks, monuments and landmarks.

Here’s an [article about the pass](https://diatribe.org/lifestyle/how-get-free-lifetime-national-parks-pass){: target="_blank" }, with some great tips. This was shared last year, and we thought it a good time to share it again!
