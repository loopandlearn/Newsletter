### `Open Mic` Zoom

_<span translate="no">Loop and Learn</span>_: Informal Discussion (`Open Mic`) zoom meetings are scheduled on the second Thursday of each month.

### Build Party Zoom

If you've been thinking about building Loop or Trio, switching between Browser Build and Mac-Xcode Build, learning how to set up a GitHub organization, or how to read the GitHub build logs when you (or others) run into issues, join our upcoming build party, scheduled for folks around the globe.

Before this session, please read the docs (Loopdocs or Triodocs - see links below). Try to build on your own if you can - we can help clear up any errors you encounter.

At a minimum:

* Xcode builders should download the latest version of Xcode that matches your phone's iOS, as well as the Xcode simulators for iOS and watchOS.
* Browser Builders should gather their Secrets and save them to their Secrets Reference File (a text file).

### Adam Brown Returns: Speaker Series Zoom

[Adam Brown](https://adambrowntherapy.com/){:target="_blank"} is coming back! He shared some important mental health-related ideas at D-Data in November 2024 and we asked him if he would Zoom with us again so that all of our members can learn from him. It’s good stuff! You can prepare yourself by [watching our previous meeting with Adam](https://youtu.be/aLKhFBoPRh8?si=UjWJwpT3y0opzvwl&t=1){:target="_blank"}.

This session will be recorded.

## Please: Do Not Struggle with Building!

We want building to be as easy as possible for you- and our mentors are here to help!

## Extreme Weather Tips

The seasons are changing! Some of us are headed into [winter fun](https://www.loopandlearn.org/winter-sports/){:target="_blank"}, while others are ready for [fun in the sun](https://www.loopandlearn.org/summer-shenanigans/){:target="_blank"}. Here are helpful tips no matter which way you’re headed.

## Happy New Year

A  few members of the Loop and Learn admin and editing team got together on Zoom to celebrate another year of working together to make Open-Source Automated Insulin Delivery (OS-AID) easier to use and more accessible to the community at large. What a special thing we have here- all of us- and we are glad you’re a part of it!

We love seeing people helping other loopers on Facebook. Don't be shy when you see a question you can answer.
