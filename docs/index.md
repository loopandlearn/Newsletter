## Your Diabetes May Vary

There was an interesting discussion in the *iAPS* Facebook group on what are reasonable expectations for results. Many of the ideas apply to any method of diabetes management.

* [Original Facebook Conversation](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1351938092206709/posts/1490301131703737/)

The&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop and Learn</span>_&nbsp;team took some of that conversation and summarized it for this edition of the news. Thanks to Odd Stoltenberg for permission to paraphrase his words.

* Do not ignore the importance of quality of life and your psychological state - it is important not to get burned out

* Do not compare your diabetes results with others without considering how their lifestyle and personality may differ from yours, as well as what other treatments they may be using

* Treatments have to work for you (or your child), and nobody but you can say where that balance should be in life and in diabetes management

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) published a joint consensus for [The Management of Type 1 Diabetes in Adults](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/44/11/2589/138492/The-Management-of-Type-1-Diabetes-in-Adults-A). They suggest that results be measured over 3 months. Don't just consider your best or worst days. The goals are:

| Measurement | Goal |
| - | - |
|Time In Range (TIR) of 70-180 mg/dL (3.9-10.0 mmol/L)| >70% of the time |
| A1c | < 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) |
| Readings <70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) | <4% of the time |
| Readings <54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) | <1% of the time |
| Readings >180 mg/dL (10.0  mmol/L) | <25% of the time |
| Readings >250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) | <5% of the time |

When taken together, TIR and A1c describe what is considered the best standard way of comparing diabetes status. There are other ways of describing results that may be even better, but have not been generally adopted.

There are many posts by enthusiasts for particular methods who present stories that may leave out important information, such as:

- The metabolism of the individual, which can impact how carbs and insulin absorption works, and how insulin resistant or insulin sensitive someone is
    - The physical condition of the individual can affect metabolism, absorption and digestion speed, and how the body reacts overall to food, insulin and exercise

- The time the individual spent learning about the medical and technical aspects of their diabetes management

- The food and drink diet the individual is willing to adhere to
    * A strict diet can make diabetes management easier, but others might feel that such limitations make life less worth living

- The personality of the individual
    * Some are more driven, some are very detail-oriented, some forget things all the time - while others do not forget a thing, some give up very easily, some get overwhelmed easily by complexity with regard to technical or medical matters

- The use of a GLP-1 like Ozempic, or equivalent, that directly impact how quickly carbs get absorbed which can reduce high glucose after meals

Any discussion stating what should be achievable can be difficult - since that often leaves a considerable number of people behind that cannot achieve what others say they should. For these people, discussions that are polarized or very assertive - are unfortunate!

Listen to what people say, but also to what they do not say, or just do not remember mentioning.
