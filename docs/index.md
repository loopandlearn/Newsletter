## Updates

### Loop 3.2.3

Loop 3.2.3 has been released.

If you want to build Loop-main 3.2.3 or Loop-dev and your phone is at iOS 17, you can build using either Browser Build or Mac-Xcode Build (which requires Xcode 15).

If you need to add xDrip4iOS and GlucoseDirect CGM interface to 3.2.3, here is the [link](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#add-lnl-patches).

### <span translate="no">iOS 17</span>

We still do not recommend updating your phone to iOS 17. But when you do the update, this is what you can expect:

* It may take some time for Apple Health to be available (this is common with major updates)
    * Plan ahead - stable glucose, no meals soon
    * While Apple Health is busy, the Loop app may not open
    * Come back in 15 minutes and try again
    * Wait another 15 minutes (reboot might interrupt the processing)
    * If your app still won't open, reboot the phone
* Your watch may not work right away
    * Try rebooting and / or reinstalling
    * Wait 24 hours, it may start working
* Widgets and Calendar entries are different and may not work
    * People are working on this

## Suggestions

### Use your Watch to Remember your Phone

You can set up your Apple Watch to help make sure you don’t leave your iPhone behind. 

Open “Find Devices” on your watch:

* Tap your phone
* Select “Notify when left behind”

### Check IOB and COB at Night

Check IOB and COB before going to sleep to see if you need to eat a snack to avoid low glucose overnight.

### Keep Phone on Automatic Time

You have been warned before to keep your phone on [Automatic Time](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/time-faqs/#loop-phone-must-be-on-automatic-time).

New trick - turn on iOS Settings -> Screen Time -> and set a passcode. 

The phone can no longer be changed to anything other than automatic time.
