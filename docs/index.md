## Build with Browser How-to Video

Mike Plante has done it again! We are excited to share this video including audio and subtitles that will help many learn to use the Browser Build method. This method is available for many open-source apps. This video focuses on using the method to build the *Loop* app.

When you click in the comments there is full index of topics and time-stamps.

> Please note that until either *GitHub* or *LoopWorkspace* is updated to fix this issue, about 25% of *GitHub* actions that require *Apple* to return a certificate to *GitHub* fail. This includes running the build action. It's a timing issue and **trying again seems to work the next time**. Should this happen to you, always try again before changing anything.

## Documentation Feature Spotlight

Hover over underlined terms in&nbsp;_<span translate="no">LoopDocs</span>_&nbsp;to see what the term means. Each of these underlined terms is also presented in the [Glossary](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/glossary/).

## Secure Your *Nightscout* Data

When showing your *Nightscout* site to someone on the internet, never send them your API secret. Check out this [link for instructions](https://nightscout.github.io/nightscout/security/#create-a-token) or follow the steps below to make a read-only access token. You can later delete the subject if you only want to temporarily share access.

1. Open Nightscout's 'hamburger' menu.
1. Go to Admin Tools, add a new Subject.
1. Name it, assign 'readable' role, and save.
1. Copy the link below Access Token.
1. Share it with your medical team!

## Check out LnL *Instagram*

We are "growing" our&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop and Learn</span>_&nbsp;*Instagram* presence, to spread our T1D and DIY knowledge ... will you "follow" and share the link to your looping friends’ communities? We’d love to grow our following by 10% this month- that’s 50 new followers. Please help us reach our goal!

## Pro Tip for Reporting Faulty Devices

Here are some ways to make calling in faulty devices as efficient as possible:

* Schedule calls to your pump and/or CGM provider on a regular, recurring basis, such as monthly. 
* Put it on the calendar. 
* If you don’t need to call, great! If you do, the time is built into your schedule.

### For <code>pods</code>:
* You will need this information
    * Lot # from the box or the paper seal on <code>pod</code> plastic tray
    * Sequence number from the <code>pod</code>
    * Date started
    * Duration of wear
    * Site location
    * Reason it’s off early
* Ideas for saving the information
    * Record it on the <code>pods</code> themselves
    * Keep a spreadsheet with the information

### For CGM:

You need the information on the package. Save the paper / box while wearing each CGM and discard at the end of successful session.
