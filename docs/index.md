### Thank You

A huge THANK YOU to all who have made our informal discussions a great success! Started by Carol Vachon in August 2023, when she decided to have a spontaneous Zoom session, they have grown into a staple for LnL and really enhanced our sense of community.

## The *Loop Caregiver* App

The *Loop Caregiver* app was updated on 2023 December 8. It provides for lockscreen widgets, which require the addition of a `LoopCaregiver App Group`. The Build with Browser instructions have changed. The Mac-Xcode Build instructions are unchanged, but you should get a fresh download.

* [`LoopCaregiver` Widgets Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Np4jusdXZERiAWZsz6QyF3b1FxT_ingJEw7R97632Hk/edit#heading=h.jn3e5xg75sf)
* [Updated Browser Build Instructions](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-other-apps/#update-to-build-with-browser-for-the-loop-caregiver-app)

The link above informs you of the one-time update needed for Browser Build. In summary:

1. `Sync` your `fork`
1. Run `Add Identifiers`
1. Follow instructions to create and add a `LoopCaregiver App Group` to all `LoopCaregiver Identifiers`
1. Run `Create Certificates`
1. Run `Build LoopCaregiver`

## The *Loop Follow* App

> Early Christmas Gift Alert for Parents!

We're thrilled to announce an update of the *Loop Follow* app, released 2023 December 6, especially helpful for parents juggling Type 1 Diabetes management for multiple kids!

Here’s what’s new:

* [Enhanced *XCode* Build Script](https://www.loopandlearn.org/loop-follow#lf-script): Effortlessly create three distinct app instances
* Customizable App Names: Personalize each app with your child's name for easy identification
* Visible In-App Display Names: Instantly know which child's data you're viewing

Thanks to Jonas Björkert for this update of the *Loop Follow* app, which will make life easier for parents juggling Type 1 Diabetes management for multiple kids!

## Unexpected Diabetes Equipment Failure

It’s always smart to think ahead and be prepared for any unexpected diabetes needs. Most Loop “failures” are when the phone is lost/stolen/drowned, or Bluetooth isn't working. Having Loop built to an accessible backup phone is the best way to get Loop back up and running quickly.

* Be sure to keep a copy of your settings in the cloud so you can access them
* Have a plan for switching to injections if you can't get your pump working
* Make sure your scheduled basal rates are kept current - especially if you are using a system that dynamically adjusts settings
