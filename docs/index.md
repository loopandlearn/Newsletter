## Reminder if you Build with Browser

When you build the *Loop* app using a browser, you must rebuild a minimum of every 90 days. If you fail to do this, you will see the message: **<span translate="no">"Loop Beta has expired"<span translate="no">** on your phone and will not be able to run&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;until you build again. Remember that your pump will revert to running your scheduled basal rates within 30 minutes when the app is not available. 

You can go into the *Testflight* app on the phone and check how many days are left on your current build and then add a reminder in your calendar to rebuild before then. [Update with Browser](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/gh-actions/gh-update/). 

If you are using the released version of the *Loop* app (`main`), consider adding the new customization that reports the *TestFlight* date. You will receive in-app reminders starting 20 days before expiration. Loop dev users are already benefitting from this feature.
