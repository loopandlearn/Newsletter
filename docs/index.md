## The Now Line

The “Now Line” is a very helpful tool, available by individual customization. It adds a vertical line to all your&nbsp;<span translate="no">Loop</span>&nbsp;charts on the main screen and to the glucose prediction on the bolus screen. This line represents the current time, aiming to make it simpler for you to interpret your data.

* [List of all customizations available](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#custom-list)
* [Direct link to the new "now_line"](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#now-line)

For those who build the app using a Browser, please note the customization templates have been updated:

## Preview for the Next Release

This section of&nbsp;[<span translate="no">LoopDocs</span>](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/version/development/#updates-in-dev)&nbsp;gives an early look at what has been added to the&nbsp;<span translate="no">dev branch of Loop</span>&nbsp; since&nbsp;<span translate="no">Loop 3.2.x</span>&nbsp;was released and will be in the next release.

* Support for&nbsp;<span translate="no">Libre</span>&nbsp;CGM
* Modified Simulator Interface
* Algorithm Experiments
    * Glucose Based Partial Application Factor
    * Integral Retrospective Correction
* Favorite Foods
* <span translate="no">TestFlight</span>&nbsp;Expiration Warning
* Building with Browser Updates
* Miscellaneous Code Fixes

## Keep Phone on Automatic Time

You have been warned before to keep your phone on [Automatic Time](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/time-faqs/#loop-phone-must-be-on-automatic-time).

New trick - turn on iOS Settings -> Screen Time -> and set a passcode. 

The phone can only be configured with automatic time.

## Reminder: Please Don't Send Mentors Private Messages

...unless you’re invited to.

If you need help, please post on the&nbsp;<span translate="no">Loop and Learn Facebook</span>&nbsp;page or [zulipchat](https://loop.zulipchat.com/).  This does several things:

* You are likely to hear back sooner because your post gets noticed sooner than a private message request will
* You are likely to get more information because more people may answer and provide more suggestions than a single mentor may think of
* A wider array of experiences may be shared
* It helps out our membership
    * Many people read through posts and learn from them, even when they aren’t in a similar situation (yet)
    * It also becomes searchable for people in the future
* Our mentors are then “free” to do their numerous jobs within the group, as they know when others are helping take care of our members

## Download, Then Customize

Would you patch a hole in a pair of jeans, then go get a new pair of jeans and expect that patch to be on them? No! S

Same with customizations; you have to add them to your most recent download if you expect them to be available.

* Download code
* Build (this is recommended but not required)
* Customize
* Build (this is your custom version)

## Text-only Edition Extras

### <span translate="no">xDrip4iOS or Glucose Direct with Loop 3.2.3</span>

<span translate="no">Loop 3.2.3</span>&nbsp;was released to support folks needing to build with Xcode 15; but the customizations that allowed people to continue using&nbsp;<span translate="no">xDrip4iOS or Glucose Direct</span>&nbsp;were not explained well. We tried to fix that.

There are some commands to use with Build with Browser or with Mac-Xcode that add an interface to these CGM inside&nbsp;<span translate="no">Loop</span>. This is valid only up through version 3.2.3.

* [Add CGM Clients: Build with Browser](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#add-lnl-patches)
* [Add CGM Clients: Mac-Xcode](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#add-cgm-323)
