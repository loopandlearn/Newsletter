## Using the *xDrip4iOS* App with Version 3.2.3 of the *Loop* App

Did you recently upgrade to Version 3.2.3 of the *Loop* App?
Did you lose access to the *xDrip4iOS* option for CGM?

Follow these directions to restore that capability:

* [Browser Build: Adding CGM Clients to 3.2.3](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#add-lnl-patches)
* [Mac-Xcode Build: Adding CGM Clients to 3.2.3](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#add-cgm-323)

Why can't I just use Apple Health? Why do I have to add CGM options?

* Without adding this customization, your *Loop* app will stop working as soon as the phone is locked
    * The *xDrip4iOS* App can write to *Apple Health* when the phone is locked
    * The *Loop* App can not **read** from *Apple Health* when the phone is locked

## Browser Build Certificate Renewal

What do I do when I get an email from Apple saying that my certificate will expire?

Follow the updated instructions in LoopDocs.
