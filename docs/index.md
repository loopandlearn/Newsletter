## Membership Milestone

The [*Loop and Learn Facebook* group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LOOPandLEARN){:target="_blank"} reached 10,000 members last week! Thanks to all who make our community and our mission THRIVE!

## Spring Forward in Europe

If your time zone changes, in the wee small hours of March 31, you can find a clock in the pump icon on the main screen of your Loop app - or on the Pump settings screen of your iAPS app. Read more about how your pump time and phone time can be different and how to [sync to the current time](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/loop-3/displays-v3/#time-zone){:target="_blank"}:

* Tap on the pump icon to go to your pump screen
* Scroll down to the Pump Time row
* If your pump time doesn't match your phone time, you can change it by tapping on the Sync to Current Time button and confirming you want to sync the time

## _<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;Settings Review using *Nightscout #2*

## iOS Updates

iOS Version Updates 17.4.1 and 16.7.7 have been successfully built and tested.

See our [Version Updates](https://www.loopandlearn.org/version-updates/){:target="_blank"} page for update info at any time!

## _<span translate="no">Loop Follow</span>_&nbsp;Updates

Our developers have been working hard on updating _<span translate="no">Loop Follow</span>_. More info to come, but here are the [version 2.1.7 release notes](https://github.com/loopandlearn/LoopFollow/releases/tag/v2.1.7){:target="_blank"}.

## Browser Build Expiration Date

The released (main) version of the *Loop* app does not report the expected expiration date if you use the Browser Build method.

If you want to see the approximate TestFlight expiration date and get in-app reminders when you need to rebuild and install a new version from TestFlight:

* [General instructions for customizing Browser Build](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#github-intro){:target="_blank"} (use the ones you want but include TestFlight Expiration)
* Details about the [TestFlight Expiration Customization](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#tf-expire){:target="_blank"}

This is not needed for the `dev` branch. The TestFlight expiration is already provided with that version.
