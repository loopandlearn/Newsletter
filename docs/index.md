## Seasonal Time Changes

Whatever the time-change is called in your area, it just happened. Be sure to update the time your app uses for your insulin pump to the new local time.

This link tells you how to update time in the *Loop* app: [Time Zones, Daylight Savings Time, Summer Time](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/time-faqs/#time-zones-daylight-savings-time-summer-time)

## The *Apple* Health App

The *Apple* Health app is an integral part of how Loop works. Be sure your permissions are set correctly. The documention has a [FAQs page](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/apple-health-faqs/).

If you recently switched to *Dexcom G7* from *Dexcom G6*, make sure you give the *Dexcom G7* app permission to write to the *Apple* Health app - please [read the documentation at this link](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/loop-3/add-cgm/#dexcom-g7).

## The *Loop Follow* App

## Diabetes Awareness Month

Many of us take Diabetes Awareness Month as an occasion to help make others aware, but there is plenty we can do to increase our own awareness. Here’s a great reminder of how well that can serve us. This was written by fellow Looper Sanda Jane last November:

> Just have to say Thank You to the&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;developers and leaders. Lots to be thankful for during Diabetes Awareness Month and as Thanksgiving approaches! 
> 
> * Started 3 Loopers at the beginning of October. The “hands-off” time has been life changing - I used to try to temp basal on and off to catch lows and bump highs 24/7, but now the algorithm does it so much better than is humanly possible, and my brain can think about other important things sometimes.
> * We have all slept more through the night than in recent memory and I would say I’ve been woken more by compression lows or 3 hour Dex outages than actual bg alerts (shouting at the diabetes gods).
> * We’ve more than doubled the number of unicorns, and without adding low bgs.
> * And seeing negative insulin onboard means I know when low treatment is needed or to just wait a minute.
> 
> Seriously can’t thank you all enough!
