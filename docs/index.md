## Updates

### <span translate="no">xDrip4iOS or Glucose Direct with Loop 3.2.3</span>

<span translate="no">Loop 3.2.3</span>&nbsp;was released to support folks needing to build with Xcode 15; but the customizations that allowed people to continue using&nbsp;<span translate="no">xDrip4iOS or Glucose Direct</span>&nbsp;were not explained well. We tried to fix that.

There are some commands to use with Build with Browser or with Mac-Xcode that add an interface to these CGM inside&nbsp;<span translate="no">Loop</span>. This is valid only up through version 3.2.3.

* [Add CGM Clients: Build with Browser](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#add-lnl-patches)
* [Add CGM Clients: Mac-Xcode](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#add-cgm-323)

### Customization

The&nbsp;[<span translate="no">Loop and Learn Customization Select Script</span>](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#custom)&nbsp;was recently updated.

The "now" mark that shows the current time on&nbsp;<span translate="no">Loop</span>&nbsp;main and bolus charts is now available as a stand-alone customization. Look for&nbsp;<span translate="no">"now_line"</span>&nbsp;to add this to your version of the app.

* [Direct link to the new "now_line"](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#now-line)

For those who build the app using a Browser, please note the customization templates have been updated:

## Suggestions

### Keep Phone on Automatic Time

You have been warned before to keep your phone on [Automatic Time](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/time-faqs/#loop-phone-must-be-on-automatic-time).

New trick - turn on iOS Settings -> Screen Time -> and set a passcode. 

The phone can no longer be changed to anything other than automatic time.
