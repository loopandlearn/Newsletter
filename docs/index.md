## Seasonal Time Changes

Whatever the time-change is called in your area, it just happened or will happen soon. Be sure to update the time your app uses for your insulin infusion-pump to the new local time.

## ISPAD 2023 Meeting Highlights

> Thanks to Miroslava Calegari, 2nd year “dedoc voice”, for this summary of a few of the high points from [ISPAD 2023](https://2023.ispad.org/)!

* The importance of widespread population screening was a central topic. It's not just about one stage of diabetes, when the disease has already set in. Unlike previous conferences (ISPAD2022, ATTD2023) while speaking a lot about Stage 1 and Stage 2 of type 1 diabetes (before clinical diagnosis), this time, much attention was given to what's being called Stage 4 of diabetes - long standing&nbsp;<span translate="no">T1D</span>.

* The evidence is clear: we should not simply wait for a universal solution to type 1 diabetes. There are various cures in the pipeline, and one size does not fit all.

* Scientists are passionately embracing the #WeAreNotWaiting mantra as well, in pursuit of a cure. The hot topics of the conference revolved around prevention, screening, immunotherapy, and beta cell replacements. DIY (Do-It-Yourself) presentations, including those by Lenka Petruzelkova (AAPS) and Katarina Braune (who, herself, is fully looped on iAPS), have become a significant part of ISPAD.

* The presence of people living with diabetes and caregivers under the #dedoc umbrella is now an essential aspect, both in the present and for the future. The most powerful resource for learning about diabetes is sharing and listening to those who live with it 24/7.

## _<span translate="no">Loop and Learn Italia</span>_

We are excited to announce that the Facebook group previously known as&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Looped Italia</span>_&nbsp;was renamed to&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop and Learn Italia</span>_! Their aim is to support Italian members in their mother language, following the example of&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop and Learn</span>_. How wonderful to have such great DIY support around the globe!

## Check the Expiration Date on Your App

No matter what kind of DIY app you use and no matter how you build, you should be aware of when that app expires and be proactive in updating or rebuilding the app before then. The link below is for the *Loop* app. If you use a different app, check the documentation for that app.
