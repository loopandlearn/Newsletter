## <span translate="no">Loop Follow</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span translate="no">iAPS</span>

We're excited to share that the official&nbsp;<span translate="no">Loop Follow</span>&nbsp;app has now been upgraded to support users using&nbsp;<span translate="no">iAPS</span>&nbsp;(formerly known as&nbsp;<span translate="no">FreeAPS X</span>). A hearty acknowledgment goes to Auggie Fisher, whose pioneering work in a separate fork made this integration feasible.

For our&nbsp;<span translate="no">iAPS</span>&nbsp;followers, some of the features were not previously available in the&nbsp;<span translate="no">FAX fork</span>, but are now at your disposal:
• Browser build capability
• Auto-signing
• Automatic workspace selection
• And other&nbsp;<span translate="no">LoopFollow</span>&nbsp;enhancements

As always, we thrive on feedback and collaboration. Test the waters with the revamped&nbsp;<span translate="no">Loop Follow</span>&nbsp;and let the&nbsp;<span translate="no">iAPS</span>&nbsp;community know your take!
