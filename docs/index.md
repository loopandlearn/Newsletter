## Updates in&nbsp;_<span translate="no">LoopDocs</span>_

The [Safety Tips](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/safety-faqs/) page has been updated. Here’s a list of topics:

* Know your settings
* Understand the App Displays
* Carb Entry and Insulin Delivery
* How to Cancel a Bolus
* Understand Delivery Limits
* Health app permissions
* Medtronic Easy Bolus button
* Finish your Medtronic priming

Additionally, this section is fairly new and should be studied. This was added in response to a FaceBook post that triggered lots of discussion:

* [How Do Delivery Limits Affect Automatic Bolusing](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/algorithm-faqs/#how-do-delivery-limits-affect-automatic-dosing)

If you are among the few who need to modify the relationship between "maximum Bolus" and "maximum IOB for Automatic Dosing", a customization was added to the [Code Customization](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/build/code-customization/) page.
