## Updates

### <span translate="no">Loop 3.2.3</span>

<span translate="no">Loop 3.2.3</span>&nbsp;has been released.

If you want to build &nbsp;<span translate="no">Loop-main 3.2.3</span>&nbsp;or &nbsp;<span translate="no">Loop-dev</span>&nbsp;and your phone is at iOS 17, you can build using either &nbsp;<span translate="no">Browser Build</span>&nbsp; or &nbsp;<span translate="no">Mac-Xcode Build</span>&nbsp; (which requires Xcode 15).

If you need to add xDrip4iOS and GlucoseDirect CGM interface to 3.2.3, the instructions are at this [Web Browser Link](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#add-lnl-patches).

### <span translate="no">iOS 17</span>

We still recommend waiting to update your phone to iOS 17.0.1. But when you do the update, this is what you can expect:

* It may take some time for&nbsp;<span translate="no">Apple Health</span>&nbsp; to be available (this is common with major updates)
    * Plan ahead - stable glucose, no meals soon
    * While&nbsp;<span translate="no">Apple Health</span>&nbsp; is busy, the&nbsp;<span translate="no">Loop</span>&nbsp;app may not open
    * Come back in 15 minutes and try again
    * Wait another 15 minutes (reboot might interrupt the processing)
    * If your app still won't open, reboot the phone
* Your watch may not work right away
    * Try rebooting and / or reinstalling
    * Wait 24 hours, it may start working
* Widgets and Calendar entries are different and may not work
    * People are working on this

### Customization

The&nbsp;[<span translate="no">Loop and Learn Customization Select Script</span>](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#custom)&nbsp; was recently updated. This only affects those using the development version of the Loop app. Several customizations are no longer needed for dev.

For those who build the app in a Browser with GitHub Actions, please note the&nbsp;[<span translate="no">Customization Template - dev</span>](https://www.loopandlearn.org/custom-code/#template-dev)&nbsp; has been updated.

## Suggestions

### Use your Watch to Remember your Phone

You can set up your&nbsp;<span translate="no">Apple Watch</span>&nbsp;to help make sure you don’t leave your iPhone behind. 

Open “Find Devices” on your watch:

* Tap your phone
* Select “Notify when left behind”

### Avoid Low Glucose while Sleeping

Check IOB and COB before going to sleep to see if you need to eat a snack to avoid low glucose overnight.

### Keep Phone on Automatic Time

You have been warned before to keep your phone on [Automatic Time](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/faqs/time-faqs/#loop-phone-must-be-on-automatic-time).

New trick - turn on iOS Settings -> Screen Time -> and set a passcode. 

The phone can no longer be changed to anything other than automatic time.
