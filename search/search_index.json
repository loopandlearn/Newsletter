It's not just about one stage of diabetes, when the disease has already set in. Unlike previous conferences (ISPAD2022, ATTD2023) while speaking a lot about Stage 1 and Stage 2 of type 1 diabetes (before clinical diagnosis), this time, much attention was given to what's being called Stage 4 of diabetes - long standing\u00a0T1D.</p> </li> <li> <p>The evidence is clear: we should not simply wait for a universal solution to type 1 diabetes. There are various cures in the pipeline, and one size does not fit all.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scientists are passionately embracing the #WeAreNotWaiting mantra as well, in pursuit of a cure. The hot topics of the conference revolved around prevention, screening, immunotherapy, and beta cell replacements. DIY (Do-It-Yourself) presentations, including those by Lenka Petruzelkova (AAPS) and Katarina Braune (who, herself, is fully looped on iAPS), have become a significant part of ISPAD.</p> </li> <li> <p>The presence of people living with diabetes and caregivers under the #dedoc umbrella is now an essential aspect, both in the present and for the future.

It\u2019s a smaller conference but it focuses on the bleeding edge of diabetes technology and innovation. Over the course of two days, many fascinating presentations were given, ranging from a start-up\u2019s debut to commercial Goliaths putting their newest products on display.</p> <p>Kicking off the event was Dean Kamen. He is the inventor (1976) of the first wearable insulin pump, AutoSyringe. He also developed the iBot which led to the Segway. Other projects include the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine and the <code>FIRST Robotics Competition</code> and don't miss this cool advertisement created when the competition went global: FIRST Global - Not A Robot. His current projects include both mass producing beta cell lines for research and a new insulin pump that delivers in the intradermal layer instead of the subcutaneous layer which should make it faster and more efficient.</p> <p>Later in the event, there was also a presentation for a new open source CGM that reads glucose in the intradermal layer with essentially no lag time.</p> <p>Event activities also included a fashion show and crafts session with diabetes supplies and a brainstorming session about the pros and cons of real time CGM access in the healthcare realm.</p> <p>Since <code>d-data</code> was the birthplace of the #WeAreNotWaiting movement, in 2013, it was appropriate that DIY legend Ben West gave a presentation on keeping diabetes open source innovation alive. Other open source presentations included iAPS, and a new fully closed loop (FCL) system by Nascence Biomed combining an offshoot of AndroidAPS with proprietary commercial pump drivers, and Boost which utilizes heart rate and a step counter to help automate an FCL.</p> <p>As intriguing as the presentations were, though, I think the networking and meeting so many other like-minded individuals from across the DIY diabetes community was my favorite part. There\u2019s just something about being with so many other people who understand what we\u2019re all going through and who are constantly pushing for new innovations. We even went out for pizza and gelato where a whole table didn\u2019t bolus and just let their DIY system automate everything for them.</p>"},{"location":"edition/2023-11-19/#diabetes-awareness-month","title":"Diabetes Awareness Month","text":"<p>November is Diabetes Awareness Month.

Thanks to Odd Stoltenberg for permission to paraphrase his words.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Do not ignore the importance of quality of life and your psychological state - it is important not to get burned out</p> </li> <li> <p>Do not compare your diabetes results with others without considering how their lifestyle and personality may differ from yours, as well as what other treatments they may be using</p> </li> <li> <p>Treatments have to work for you (or your child), and nobody but you can say where that balance should be in life and in diabetes management</p> </li> </ul> <p>The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) published a joint consensus for The Management of Type 1 Diabetes in Adults. They suggest that results be measured over 3 months. Don't just consider your best or worst days. The goals are:</p> Measurement Goal Time In Range (TIR) of 70-180 mg/dL (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) &gt;70% of the time A1C &lt; 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) Readings &lt;70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) &lt;4% of the time Readings &lt;54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) &lt;1% of the time Readings &gt;180 mg/dL (10.0  mmol/L) &lt;25% of the time Readings &gt;250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) &lt;5% of the time <p>When taken together, Time In Range (TIR) and A1C are considered the standard way of comparing diabetes status. There are other ways of describing results, but they have not been generally adopted.</p> <p>There are many posts by enthusiasts for particular methods who present stories that may leave out important information, such as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Individual physical condition and genetics can affect metabolism and how the body reacts overall to food, insulin and exercise</p> </li> <li> <p>The time the individual spent learning about the medical and technical aspects of their diabetes management</p> </li> <li> <p>The personality of the individual</p> <ul> <li>Some are more driven, some are very detail-oriented, some forget things all the time - while others do not forget a thing, some give up very easily, some get overwhelmed easily by complexity with regard to technical or medical matters</li> <li>A strict diet or always prebolusing can make diabetes management easier, but others might feel that such limitations make life less enjoyable</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Whether additional medications are used</p> <ul> <li>For example, a GLP-1 (like Ozempic or equivalent) will impact how quickly carbs get absorbed which can reduce high glucose after meals</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Any discussion stating what should be achievable can be difficult - since that often leaves a considerable number of people behind that cannot achieve what others say they should.

If the Loop app continues to crash because of a time change, even after you restore time to automatic, you will have to delete Loop off the phone completely, rebuild a fresh version, and repopulate all settings, overrides and options to resolve the issue.</p> <p>Why would someone change the time on their phone?</p> <p>One reason is to get more gaming time. So if you or your T1D child use the Loop phone for gaming, do yourself a favor and don\u2019t change the time! Lock out the options with: iOS Settings, Screen Time, Lock Screen Time Settings and apply a PIN. This disables the ability for anything other than automatic time.</p> <p>To check that your phone is on automatic time, go to iOS Settings, General, Date &amp; Time.</p>"},{"location":"edition/2024-01-21/#helpful-links","title":"Helpful Links","text":"<ul> <li>Subscribe to get the Newsletter delivered to your email weekly.<ul> <li>Some articles in the original Newsletter are not reproduced here</li> </ul> </li> <li>Check for Updates</li> <li>Find a Health Care Provider who will support your use of\u00a0Loop</li> <li>Loop and Learn\u00a0Resources Page</li> <li><code>Loop</code>:<ul> <li><code>LoopDocs</code></li> <li><code>LoopTips</code></li> <li><code>Loop</code> Zulipchat</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>iAPS</code>:<ul> <li>iAPS Website</li> <li>iAPS Documentation</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>Loop and Learn</code><ul> <li>Website</li> <li>Facebook</li> <li>Instagram</li> <li>YouTube</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"edition/2024-01-28/","title":"2024-01-28","text":""},{"location":"edition/2024-01-28/#welcome-to-news-from-loop-and-learn","title":"Welcome to News from\u00a0Loop and Learn","text":"<p>Master Your DIY Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery System</p> <p>Published on 28 January 2024.</p>"},{"location":"edition/2024-01-28/#in-this-edition","title":"In this edition:","text":"<ul> <li>Zoom Sessions</li> <li>Updates and Upgrades</li> <li>A Model Request for Help</li> <li>DIY, Not \u201cHave Someone Do It For You\u201d</li> <li>Helpful Links</li> </ul>"},{"location":"edition/2024-01-28/#upcoming-zoom-sessions","title":"Upcoming Zoom Sessions","text":"<p>Zoom Sessions use this link:</p> <ul> <li>https://us06web.zoom.us/j/89085412738?pwd=eXpTN2M5V3M0TEVJQktmVldBTVRYUT09</li> </ul> Topic Recorded?

The specific update mentioned here is from 2.3.3 to 3.0, but this holds for all updates in the future.</p> <p>For those readers who use iAPS, please wait to update any iAPS release until experts in the community have a chance to test and confirm the release.</p> <p>Post from 10 February 2024 repeated here:</p> <p>iAPS has had a large increase in users over the last year. However, the development method has not changed. iAPS is still maintained by Jon B. M\u00e5rtensson with contributions from other developers. Jon decides when to merge code into the different branches, and he decides when to make a Main release. Jon is not on Facebook, and will not be commenting on this post. He is available on Discord.</p> <p>With the increasing number of users, some of us (including Theresa Hastings, Dan H. Moody, Tom Barrows, Mike Plante, and many more) have tried to help Jon move towards a more controlled release cycle, with peer programming, proper release testing, improved documentation, etc. Jon, bless him, spends most of his free time developing iAPS. He believes that changing the ways of work will slow down development and take away his freedom to choose what to do with the app. I believe he is right, but I still believe this is what should be done - to make sure iAPS has a level of quality that matches the increasing number of users. It's not just a few advanced users anymore.</p> <p>With the help from Kelsey Huss we also got Scott and Dana (authors of the Oref algorithm) involved, to try to find a way to move things forward in a safe manner. Still, all code from the DEV branch was merged into MAIN and released as version 3.0 today.</p> <p>The release notes are not complete. We know that this version contains several bug fixes, some design changes and some new features. That is a good thing! But we also know that this release contains code that has not been tested for more than a couple of days, and other changes that should have been tested on a broader user base before releasing to everyone - like the new bolus calculator, and new remote features.</p> <p>I believe that iAPS Main 3.0 is an experimental app at the moment. It should be used with caution, only by people who are closely following the Discord group and ready to re-build on short notice. If you decide to use iAPS Main 3.0 now, you should be prepared for it not to work as expected. That includes bringing along low treatments, extra pods, your PDM (if you use Omnipod) and insulin pens at all times.</p> <p>Some of us will devote our time to testing this release and let you all know when it is safe. This will take time.</p> <p>Link to iAPS Discord.</p>"},{"location":"edition/2024-02-12/#selecting-iaps-version","title":"Selecting iAPS version","text":""},{"location":"edition/2024-02-12/#browser-build","title":"Browser Build","text":"<p>This great (&lt; 3 minute) video shows how to build 2.3.3 with Browser Build.

Fortunately, a simple and effective solution has been suggested by a user on Discord and tested by several members of our team, yielding positive results. If you're experiencing any of these problems, you can consider this method.</p> <p>The information given here is based on personal experiences and is not intended as medical advice. Always consult your healthcare provider before making any changes to your treatment.</p> <p>Consider the fact that this method depends on inserting the cannula through a piece of medical tape attached to the skin. You may not be willing to take that action.</p> <p>The method involves placing a piece of Tegaderm or OpSite Flexifix dressing on your skin prior to applying your <code>pod</code>. Apply the <code>pod</code> directly over it without cutting a hole for the cannula. The dressing only needs to be in the area of the cannula, it does not need to be as big as the <code>pod</code>. This technique has been successful in stabilizing the cannula and preventing many of the aforementioned issues, ultimately extending the use time of the site.</p> <p>The rationale behind this approach is that it stabilizes where the cannula enters the skin, limiting motion that can lead to leaking. Several members report the site remains functional for a longer duration with more stability in day-to-day insulin needs.</p> <p>For individuals dealing with <code>pod</code> adhesive irritation, apply a sufficiently large piece of dressing to fit under the entire <code>pod</code>.

A while later, she found that her CGM reading was actually almost 10X what her real blood glucose level was and had an emergency on her hands. Thankfully, she remained safe! Many CGM users report never doing fingersticks, but we ask you to rethink that, even if only after starting new sensors, as they often come online reading incorrectly. </p> <p>Read this post on Facebook in CGMitC Off Topic #T1DIY for more details and to see some excellent advice.

Early detection, especially in Italy, which initiated the world\u2019s first antibody screening program this year, was also topical. A big highlight was the presentation of a consensus position statement on DIY systems, which aligns with that of Italian Scientific Societies. Efforts to bridge gaps in diabetes technology access and affordability were also highlighted, and immunotherapy, type 2 diabetes, women\u2019s diabetes issues, and interoperability were also discussed.</p> <p>In terms of technology, the integration of pumps and <code>CGM</code> (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) into one device and non-invasive glucometers capable of detecting glucose in breath samples were of interest. It will be interesting to see which of these innovative technologies will become mainstream! There is an expectation of achieving a fully closed-loop commercial system in the next 3-5 years, with <code>CGM</code> being pushed as the standard of care for every person living with diabetes (<code>PWD</code>). Similarly, GLP-1/SLGT-2s are being promoted, but there is growing concern that long-term use might have downsides, and when <code>PWD</code> stop using them, they often experience more pronounced issues than before using them.</p> <p>There is still a huge gap in professionals\u2019 understanding of <code>PWD</code> and the significant mental burden associated with it. Efforts such as the UNLOK educational program, along with the introduction of more AI tools and learning programs for healthcare professionals, aim to bridge this gap. Additionally, the Diabetes Technology Expert program, presented by Dr. Inge Van Boxelaer, a certified diabetes instructor and endocrinologist, is/will be available in 30 languages. It offers free learning modules focusing on open-source AID systems: AAPS, Loop, and iAPS.</p> <p>We appreciate Dr. Inge's outreach to our\u00a0Loop and Learn\u00a0community for feedback and consultation.

When I return, I edit the insulin needs from 65% (needed while I'm actively biking) back to 100%. My negative IOB typically doubles at that change. I then disable the override and take the full negative IOB as a bolus. This helps prevent a post-exercise high that often follows my ride.</p> <p>I do not enter any carbs while biking and almost always ride first thing in the morning while fasting, so I just edit the override.

Because this is an insulin-dosing algorithm rather than a game, extra care is used. Before announcing the beta test, the Trio developers kept the repositories private. As part of the private testing, the developers used this app on themselves as well as test phones. They had the advantage of starting with iAPS version 2.3.3 so they could build on the work of many developers. Once they felt it was ready for beta test, the repositories were opened for public access.</p> <p>During the beta test, the app is only recommended for experienced testers. As it nears the end of beta test, there will be a release candidate (for final review) followed by a release to Trio version 1.0.0.
