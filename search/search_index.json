It's not just about one stage of diabetes, when the disease has already set in. Unlike previous conferences (ISPAD2022, ATTD2023) while speaking a lot about Stage 1 and Stage 2 of type 1 diabetes (before clinical diagnosis), this time, much attention was given to what's being called Stage 4 of diabetes - long standing\u00a0T1D.</p> </li> <li> <p>The evidence is clear: we should not simply wait for a universal solution to type 1 diabetes. There are various cures in the pipeline, and one size does not fit all.</p> </li> <li> <p>Scientists are passionately embracing the #WeAreNotWaiting mantra as well, in pursuit of a cure. The hot topics of the conference revolved around prevention, screening, immunotherapy, and beta cell replacements. DIY (Do-It-Yourself) presentations, including those by Lenka Petruzelkova (AAPS) and Katarina Braune (who, herself, is fully looped on iAPS), have become a significant part of ISPAD.</p> </li> <li> <p>The presence of people living with diabetes and caregivers under the #dedoc umbrella is now an essential aspect, both in the present and for the future.

It\u2019s a smaller conference but it focuses on the bleeding edge of diabetes technology and innovation. Over the course of two days, many fascinating presentations were given, ranging from a start-up\u2019s debut to commercial Goliaths putting their newest products on display.</p> <p>Kicking off the event was Dean Kamen. He is the inventor (1976) of the first wearable insulin pump, AutoSyringe. He also developed the iBot which led to the Segway. Other projects include the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine and the <code>FIRST Robotics Competition</code> and don't miss this cool advertisement created when the competition went global: FIRST Global - Not A Robot. His current projects include both mass producing beta cell lines for research and a new insulin pump that delivers in the intradermal layer instead of the subcutaneous layer which should make it faster and more efficient.</p> <p>Later in the event, there was also a presentation for a new open source CGM that reads glucose in the intradermal layer with essentially no lag time.</p> <p>Event activities also included a fashion show and crafts session with diabetes supplies and a brainstorming session about the pros and cons of real time CGM access in the healthcare realm.</p> <p>Since <code>d-data</code> was the birthplace of the #WeAreNotWaiting movement, in 2013, it was appropriate that DIY legend Ben West gave a presentation on keeping diabetes open source innovation alive. Other open source presentations included iAPS, and a new fully closed loop (FCL) system by Nascence Biomed combining an offshoot of AndroidAPS with proprietary commercial pump drivers, and Boost which utilizes heart rate and a step counter to help automate an FCL.</p> <p>As intriguing as the presentations were, though, I think the networking and meeting so many other like-minded individuals from across the DIY diabetes community was my favorite part. There\u2019s just something about being with so many other people who understand what we\u2019re all going through and who are constantly pushing for new innovations. We even went out for pizza and gelato where a whole table didn\u2019t bolus and just let their DIY system automate everything for them.</p>"},{"location":"edition/2023-11-19/#diabetes-awareness-month","title":"Diabetes Awareness Month","text":"<p>November is Diabetes Awareness Month.

Thanks to Odd Stoltenberg for permission to paraphrase his words.</p> <ul> <li> <p>Do not ignore the importance of quality of life and your psychological state - it is important not to get burned out</p> </li> <li> <p>Do not compare your diabetes results with others without considering how their lifestyle and personality may differ from yours, as well as what other treatments they may be using</p> </li> <li> <p>Treatments have to work for you (or your child), and nobody but you can say where that balance should be in life and in diabetes management</p> </li> </ul> <p>The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) published a joint consensus for The Management of Type 1 Diabetes in Adults. They suggest that results be measured over 3 months. Don't just consider your best or worst days. The goals are:</p> Measurement Goal Time In Range (TIR) of 70-180 mg/dL (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) &gt;70% of the time A1C &lt; 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) Readings &lt;70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) &lt;4% of the time Readings &lt;54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) &lt;1% of the time Readings &gt;180 mg/dL (10.0  mmol/L) &lt;25% of the time Readings &gt;250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) &lt;5% of the time <p>When taken together, Time In Range (TIR) and A1C are considered the standard way of comparing diabetes status. There are other ways of describing results, but they have not been generally adopted.</p> <p>There are many posts by enthusiasts for particular methods who present stories that may leave out important information, such as:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Individual physical condition and genetics can affect metabolism and how the body reacts overall to food, insulin and exercise</p> </li> <li> <p>The time the individual spent learning about the medical and technical aspects of their diabetes management</p> </li> <li> <p>The personality of the individual</p> <ul> <li>Some are more driven, some are very detail-oriented, some forget things all the time - while others do not forget a thing, some give up very easily, some get overwhelmed easily by complexity with regard to technical or medical matters</li> <li>A strict diet or always prebolusing can make diabetes management easier, but others might feel that such limitations make life less enjoyable</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Whether additional medications are used</p> <ul> <li>For example, a GLP-1 (like Ozempic or equivalent) will impact how quickly carbs get absorbed which can reduce high glucose after meals</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Any discussion stating what should be achievable can be difficult - since that often leaves a considerable number of people behind that cannot achieve what others say they should.
